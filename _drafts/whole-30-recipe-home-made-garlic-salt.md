title: Whole 30 Recipe - Home Made Garlic Salt

---
Every cook whether amateur or professional tends to have a special relationship with salt.  [Tim Ferris](http://tim.blog/) of the [Four Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1487458366&sr=8-2&keywords=tim+ferriss) and [Four Hour Chef](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1487458366&sr=8-4&keywords=tim+ferriss) fame claims that his salt of choice is Gray Maldon Sea Salt.

For myself it is plain 'ol [Lawry's Garlic Salt](https://www.amazon.com/Lawrys-Garlic-Salt-33-Ounce/dp/B00HPN6A86).  My wife turned me onto this back in 2003 and I've been using it ever since.  Unfortunately my recent venture into the Whole 30 diet made me realize that the standard Lawry's Garlic salt has a bunch of crap in it including **sugar**.  Sugar, while wonderful at times, has no place in what is supposed to be salt.  Here's my recipe for a Whole 30 compliant version of garlic salt.

# Ingredients

* 3/4 cup salt of your preferred type
* 1/2 cup granulated garlic powder
* 1/4 cup garlic powder (this is the fluffy version of the above)
* 1/4 cup dried parsley

# Steps

1.  Combine all ingredients into a container.
2.  Mix together.
