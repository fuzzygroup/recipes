A good friend of mine makes this and I adore this particular dessert.  Her version, however, was not gluten free and thus excluded celiac folks.  I made a stab at addressing that as well as I added a blueberry syrup to channel that wonderful Lemon - Blueberry flavor mix that I am personally very fond of.
# Ingredients

## Cake
* 1 gluten free vanilla or lemon cake mix; I used Pamela's and I'd recommend it
* 1 package lemon jello, small size (not the giant)
* 3/4 cups water
* 3/4 cups oil
* 4 eggs
* 1 1/2 T lemon juice (I boosted this considerably to allow for the fact that I had a white, vanilla cake mix)
* Zest of one lemon 

## Lemon Glaze

* 6 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar

## Blueberry Sauce

* 2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen
* 1/2 cup sugar or honey
* 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons water, divided
* 1 Tablespoon cornstarch (or tapioca starch for grain-free)

# Steps

## Lemon Glaze

1.  In a bowl combine lemon juice and powdered sugar.
2.  Mix well.

## Cake

1.  In a stand mixer combine eggs and all liquid ingredients and mix well.
2.  Add cake mix and lemon zest and mix well.
3.  Pour into sheet cake pan, 13x9, and bake at 325 for 35 minutes until toothpick inserted comes clean
4. When cake comes out of oven, let cool for 10 minutes and then puncture the top repeatedly with tines of a fork or a wooden skewer and pour lemon glaze over it.
5. Serve with blueberry sauce drizzled over it.

## Blueberry Sauce

1.  Combine 2 Tablespoons water and cornstarch in a small dish and set aside.
2.  In a medium saucepan, bring water, sugar or honey, and blueberries to a boil. Stir occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add water+starch mixture and blend well. The sauce will thicken, the blueberries will have busted open and it begins to smell like pie.
3.  Store in refrigerator up to two weeks. Take out a few minutes before serving at room temperature or warm.
