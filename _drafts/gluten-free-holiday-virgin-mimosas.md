If you are a non drinker (or a kid) and you are envious of the nice cocktails other people get, this one is actually quite nice.

## Ingredients

* Club Soda
* Orange Juice
* Cranberry Simple Syrup Paste

## Steps

1. Combine club soda and orange juice in a tall glass.
2. Add a tbsp or so of the cranberry paste and stir.
3. Feel like an adult while those around you are consuming drinks and feeling more like kids.
