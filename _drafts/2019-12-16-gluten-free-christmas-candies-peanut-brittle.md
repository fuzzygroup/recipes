Peanut Brittle
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup*
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup water
1 cup peanuts
2 Tbsp butter, softened
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp vanilla (optional)

Grease a large cookie sheet; set aside.

In a 2-quart saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, salt, and water over medium heat.  Cook, stirring frequently, until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit.  At this point, add the peanuts and continue cooking until it reaches 300 degrees.  If it doesn't reach 300 degrees, it will be more sticky and not so crunchy; if you let it go higher than 300 degrees, you risk burning it.  Remove from heat and quickly add butter, baking soda, and vanilla.  Sorry I have no pictures at this point, because I was just trying to get it done before it cooled too much.  Pour onto greased cookie sheet and spread it around.  It will begin to harden quickly, so you'll need to work quickly.  Also, it doesn't have to look perfect, so don't worry about spreading it perfectly even.  Allow to cool; break into pieces.

A similar good recipe is:
