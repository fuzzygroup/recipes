## Ingredients

* 1 small can tomato paste
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 10 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
* 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, plus extra as needed
* 1 cup brewed coffee 
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 tbsp dark brown sugar, packed
* 2 poblano peppers, mostly seeded, chopped
* 1.5 to 2 pounds country-style pork ribs, boneless if possible but not essential, fat trimmed
* kosher salt, as needed
* black pepper, freshly ground, as needed
* 2 cans pinto beans drained
* 1 can corn, fire roasted if possible
* 1/4 cup cilantro, minced fresh, plus more for garnish
* Juice of 1 lime or 3 tsp bottled lime juice
* Zest of 1/2 lime

## Steps

1. Lightly oil inside of slow cooker with vegetable oil or cooking spray.
2. Combine tomato paste, chili powder, oil, and garlic in a bowl and microwave, occasionally stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared slow cooker.
3. Whisk in broth, coffee, cornstarch, and sugar. Add peppers.
4. Turn oven to broil.  Season ribs with chili powder and broil 3 minutes per side (so about 12 minutes total).
4. Generously season ribs with salt and pepper and nestle into slow cooker. Cover and cook until ribs are tender, and the meat falls apart with little resistance, 5 to 6 hours on low or 3 to 4 hours on high.
5. Turn the ribs over halfway through cooking to ensure even braising.. 
6. Using a large spoon, skim excess fat from surface of chili and discard; this may not be necessary.
7. Remove pork and transfer to a plate.
8. Break ribs into 1-inch pieces, removing any excess fat.
9. Adjust chili consistency with extra hot broth as needed.
10. Add back meat, beans, and corn to the slow cooker. Cook on high for 30 minutes. 
11. Stir in cilantro, lime zest, and juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with garnishes if desired.
