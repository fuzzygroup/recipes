title: Gluten Free Air Fryer Jambalaya Arancini Appetizers

Arancini is a classic Italian appetizer that consists of taking chilled risotto, shaping it into balls, breading them and then deep frying them.  Given that Jambalaya is essentially "Cajun Risotto", I realized the other night that you could probably take Jambalaya and make arancini from it.  And then, you could use an Air Fryer to avoid having to deep fry them.
