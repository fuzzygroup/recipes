## Ingredients

* 1 can sweetened condensed milk, 14 oz
* 1/2 cup or 1 1/2 ounces dutch process cocoa (but plain Hershey’s cocoa works just fine)
* 2 tbsp or 2 ounces unsalted butter
* sprinkles, colored sugar or non-pareils for coating

## Steps

1. Grease 11x9” ceramic baking dish (8” square works as well).
2. Combine condensed milk, cocoa and butter in medium saucepan.
3.  Cook over very low heat, stirring frequently until mixture is very thick and rubber spatula leaves trail when dragged thru, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Pour mixture into prepared dish and refrigerate until cool, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
5. Cut into a grid of roughly 1/2 to 3/4” in size and then remove each square and roll into a ball. 
6. Dip in coatings and then refrigerate.
