title: Gluten Free Amaretto Toddy
---


Shelley is sick as a dog (some kind of upper respiratory thing).  The thing that's making her feel better is a hot beverage I make her.  Here's the recipe in case you too are sick this holiday season.

Note: Adults Only; This has Amaretto in it.

Recipe for an Amaretto Toddy

* 1 Coffee Mug 2/3 Full of Water
* Honey
* Half a Lemon
* Amaretto

1. Heat the mug for 2 1/2 minutes in the microwave or until as hot as you can stand.
2. Add as much honey as you like.  I tend to do about a tablespoon.
3. Take a small wire strainer and place it on top of the mug and squeeze the lemon into the mug.  This keeps the pits of the lemon out of the drink.
4. Top the mug off with Amaretto until it is full.
5.  Stir.
