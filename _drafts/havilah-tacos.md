# Ingredients

* 2 lb ground beef, 1 sirloin and 1 chuck

* 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Frank's Red Hot

# Steps

1.  Brown beef in frying pan until cooked; add Frank's Red Hot, salt, pepper, cumin and garlic powder generously as you go (add these in stages).
2.  Add the refried beans to the cooked beef and break it down down and integrate it into the beef until smooth.
3.  Re-add all the spices including Frank's red hot.  Blend it together, cook and then taste.  Generally you'll have to add more salt and more Frank's red hot.
4. Heat a small frying pan of oil to 350 and adjust the temperature to keep it there.
5. Take a pot holder and double fold two paper towels across the pot holder.
6. Fry the tortillas, one by one, 15 to 30 seconds each until you see bubbles appear in the tortilla.  Flip them once or twice per.
7. Take the tortilla out and put it on the pot holder.  
8. Add 1 to 2 tbsp of beef mixture to the tortilla.
9. Top with 1 to 2 pinches of cheese.
10. Fold the tortilla in half to make it a taco.
11. Add it to a baking pan, standing it on end.
12. Repeat until all tortillas are filled.
