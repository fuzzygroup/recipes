## Ingredients

* 4 egg whites
* 4 egg yolks (when you separate the yolks from the whites put the yolks into individual coffee cups or small bowls)
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan or other grated cheese
* 1 tbsp grated parmesan or other grated cheese
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 450 and cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  In a standing mixer whip whites to sharp peaks.  In a Kitchenaid this is generally 7 minutes.
3. Add salt and pepper at the end.
4. Fold in the 1/4 cup cheese taking care not to deflate the whites.
5. Make nests of the whites on the baking sheet taking care to leave a small divot for the yolk.
6. Bake the whites for 3 minutes.
7. Remove the whites from the oven, add the yolks and sprinkle the 1 tbsp parmesan over the tops.
8. Bake for 3 additional minutes.
