If you follow the food world as of late there is a whole movement seemingly referred to as "[Hoof to Snout](https://www.foodnewsfeed.com/fsr/going-whole-hog)".  The idea here is to use all of the animal.  And while I personally find some parts of the animal less than desirable (organ meats; really ...), conceptually I approve of the idea of less waste.  

I recently encountered this while making a batch of peach moonshine.  There are two types of waste:

* Peach Skins
* Peach Pits

Given that peach pits are a means a extracting cyanide, I thought "maybe I should read random recipes on the Internet and make homemade almond extract" but what I could do is candy the peach skins so ...

# Ingredients

* [Peach Simple Syrup](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/cocktail/2019/08/04/gluten-free-peach-simple-syrup.html)
* A big 'ol pile of peach skins, preferably from making [Peach Moonshine](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/cocktail/2019/08/04/gluten-free-peach-moonshine.html)

# Steps

1.  Take a small frying pan and add about 1/4 cup of Peach Simple Syrup
2.  Add the peach skins and saute in the simple syrup until they reduce and become coated.

# Serving Ideas

These are delicious eaten all on their own but they are absolutely delightful as a pancake topping.  Even gluten free pancakes (I recommend the [Krusteaz brand](https://www.krusteaz.com/products/pancakes-waffles-gluten-free-mixes/gluten-free-buttermilk-pancake-mix)) are excellent this way.
