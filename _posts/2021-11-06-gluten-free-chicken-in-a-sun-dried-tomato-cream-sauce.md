## Ingredients

* 3 pounds chicken breasts diced in half horizontally
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more, to taste
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 2/3 cup julienned sun dried tomatoes in olive oil, drained
* 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
* 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/4 cup basil leaves, chiffonade

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper, to taste.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side; set aside.
4. Melt remaining tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, heavy cream, sun dried tomatoes, Parmesan, thyme, oregano and basil.
5. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet.
6. Place into oven and roast until completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, about 25-30 minutes.
7. Serve immediately, garnished with basil, if desired.
