## Ingredients

* 3 thin-skinned lemons (3 to 3 1/2 ounces each)
* 1 cup sugar
* 4 cups cold water, divided
* Ice, for serving

## Steps

1. Wash the lemons to remove any waxy coating. Trim the hard stem end; cut the lemons into quarters and remove the seeds. Cut the quarters into large chunks. Add to blender.  Note: If your lemon has thicker skin, or if the blossom end is thick, trim it to reduce bitterness.

2. Add the sugar and 3 cups water to the carafe of a blender. Blend on high until smooth, about 30 seconds.

3. Strain the lemonade over a pitcher using a fine-mesh sieve. Use a silicone spatula to press the pulp against the strainer and wring out the remaining juice. Discard the pulp or reuse it in something else (lemony baked good, perhaps).

4. Add the remaining 1 cup of water and stir to combine. Serve lemonade over ice.
