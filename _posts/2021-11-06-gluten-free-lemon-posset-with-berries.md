## Ingredients

*  2 cups heavy cream
* 2/3 cup sugar (4 2/3 ounces)
* 1 tbsp grated lemon zest
* 6 tbsp lemon juice (2 lemons)
* 1 1/2 cups blueberries or raspberries (7 1/2 ounces)

## Steps

1. Combine cream, sugar and lemon zest in medium saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat.  Continue to boil, stirring frequently to dissolve sugar.  If mixture begins to boil over, briefly remove from heat.  Cook until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, 8 to 12 minutes.
2. Off heat stir in lemon juice.  Let sit until mixture has cooled slightly and skin has formed on surface, about 20 minutes.  Strain through fine mess strainer into bowl; discard zest.  Divide mixture evenly amount 6 individual ramekins or serving glasses.
