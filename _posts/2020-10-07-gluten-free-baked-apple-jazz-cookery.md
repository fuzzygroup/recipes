After making these for Shelley and Lisa, my friend Amanda asked for the recipe and so here it is.  Normally these fall into what I refer to as "Jazz Cookery", the type of creation that comes from simply having a handful of ingredients on hand and riffing with them.  But if you want something to be re-create-able then a recipe does matter so ...

## Ingredients

* 5 apples (or however many you want); I favor Honey Crisp for this but Granny Smith are also delightful
* 3/4 cup of oats
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar to your preference
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 stick melted butter
* 1 cup warm apple cider

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350.
2. Prepare a mixture of the oats, melted butter, sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.
3. Get out a 8 by 8 pan or 9" round pan used for baking a cake; just big enough to hold the number of apples.
4. Core the apples and cut a divot out of the top (i.e. make the hole at the top wider by spiraling the knife around the top of the apple).
5. Fill the apples with the mixture and place them in the pan.
6. Pack any remaining filling around the apples and add the bits of apple from the divot to the pan.
7. Pour the warm cider around the apples.
8. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes to an hour.
9. Serve with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.
