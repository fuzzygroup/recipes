## Ingredients 

* 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
* 6 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder, divided
* 2 tsp. honey
* 1/4 cup light coconut milk (unsweetened, canned)
* 1/2 tsp. instant coffee granules
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* ground nuts (optional)
* colored sugar (optional)

## Steps

1. Place chocolate, 3 Tbsp. of the cocoa, honey, coconut milk, and coffee granules in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat while slowly stirring until mixture is smooth and shiny and chocolate is fully melted, about 3 minutes. Be careful that heat is not too high or mixture can burn. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla.

2. Transfer chocolate mixture to a wide, shallow bowl and refrigerate until mixture is thick and holds its shape, about 1 hour.

3. Sift remaining 3 Tbsp. cocoa into a small bowl. Scoop the truffle mixture by the 1/2 teaspoonful, roll into a ball, and drop it into the cocoa. Gently roll truffle in the cocoa to coat. Alternately, roll in ground nuts or colored sugar, if desired.

4. Store truffles in a covered container, refrigerated. Remove from the fridge a few minutes before serving.
