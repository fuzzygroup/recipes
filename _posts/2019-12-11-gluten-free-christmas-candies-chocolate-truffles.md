## Ingredients

### Ganache

* 2 cups (12 ounces) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch salt
* 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces and softened

### Coating

* 1 cup (3 ounces) Dutch-processed cocoa
* 1/4 cup (1 ounce) confectioners' sugar

## Steps

### Ganache

1.  Lightly coat 8-inch baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Make parchment sling by folding 2 long sheets of parchment so that they are as wide as baking pan. Lay sheets of parchment in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra hanging over edges of pan. Push parchment into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing flush to pan.

2. Microwave chocolate in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until mostly melted and few small chocolate pieces remain, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside. 

3. Microwave cream in measuring cup until warm to touch, about 30 seconds. 

4. Stir corn syrup, vanilla, and salt into cream and pour mixture over chocolate. 

5. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, set aside for 3 minutes, and then stir with wooden spoon to combine. 

6. Stir in butter, one piece at a time, until fully incorporated.

7. Using rubber spatula, transfer ganache to prepared pan and set aside at room temperature for 2 hours. 

8. Cover pan and transfer to refrigerator; chill for at least 2 hours. (Ganache can be stored, refrigerated, for up to 2 days.)

### Coating

1. Sift cocoa and sugar through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl. Sift again into large cake pan and set aside.

2. Gripping overhanging parchment, lift ganache from pan. Cut ganache into sixty-four 1-inch squares (8 rows by 8 rows). (If ganache cracks during slicing, let sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes and then proceed.) 

3. Dust hands lightly with cocoa mixture to prevent ganache from sticking and roll each square into ball. 

4. Transfer balls to cake pan with cocoa mixture and roll to evenly coat. Lightly shake truffles in hand over pan to remove excess coating. Transfer coated truffles to airtight container and repeat until all ganache squares are rolled and coated. 

5. Cover container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 1 week. In an ideal world, let truffles sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.  But, let's face facts, **chocolate**, you aren't going to do this so just plain enjoy and *eat with purpose*!
