## Ingredients

* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce (yes the Louisiana style hot sauce really matters; for this Sriracha just isn't the same)
* 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons capers, roughly chopped (balsamic capers if possible)
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon mild paprika
* 1 scallion, finely chopped
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, parsley, hot sauce, whole-grain mustard, garlic, capers, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, scallion, salt, and cayenne pepper. 
2. Let sit for 1 hour for flavors to combine, then serve or cover and store in the refrigerator.
