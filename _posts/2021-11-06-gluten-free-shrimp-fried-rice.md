## Ingredients

* 1 cup long grain white rice
* 8 ounces large shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed
* 2 tsp soy sauce, divided
* 1 1/2 tsp packed brown sugar
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 2 tsp sambal olek
* 1 1/2 tsp dry sherry (optional)
* 1 1/2 tsp ketchup
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil, divided
* 2 large eggs lightly beaten
* 4 scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thin
* 1 garlic clove minced
* 1/4 cup frozen peas

## Steps

1. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and tender, about 12 minutes. Drain rice in fine-mesh strainer or colander.
2. Meanwhile, cut shrimp into Â½-inch pieces. Combine 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sugar, and shrimp in bowl; set aside. In separate bowl, combine oyster sauce; sambal oelek; sherry, if using; ketchup; salt; pepper; and remaining 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Set aside.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp and cook, stirring frequently, until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer to clean bowl.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add eggs and stir with rubber spatula until set but still wet, about 15 seconds. Push eggs to 1 side of skillet. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, scallion whites, and garlic to empty side of skillet and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.
5. Add rice and stir to break up clumps and any large egg curds. Cook until rice begins to sizzle and pop loudly, about 3 minutes. Stir in oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Stir in peas, shrimp, and scallion greens and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Serve.
