title: Quick and Easy Gluten Free Pizza Sauce
---
Here's a quick and easy Pizza Sauce that I threw together when we didn't have anything bottled without "Natural Flavor" (a term which fills me with terror -- what is it?  List the damn ingredients!).

# Ingredients

* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 can fire roasted garlic tomatoes
* 1 can tomato sauce
* 1 tbsp diced basil 

# Steps

1.  Combine in blender.
2.  Whiz together until degree of desired chunkiness or smoothness.
