# Ingredients

1¼	cups almond flour
½	teaspoon salt
½	teaspoon baking soda
1	stick unsalted butter, softened
¾	cup sugar
1	large egg
½	teaspoon vanilla extract
Passion fruit or mango sorbet, for serving

# Steps

1. Whisk the almond flour, salt and baking soda in a bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a separate bowl with a mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla until smooth, then mix in the dry ingredients. Refrigerate the dough until firm, about 30 minutes.

2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper. Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of dough about 3 inches apart on the prepared sheets. Bake until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes.

3. Let the cookies cool about 2 minutes on the baking sheets. One at a time, gently lift each cookie with an offset spatula. Immediately wrap it around the handle of a wooden spoon to curl. Once it sets, slide the cookie off the handle and let cool on a rack. Repeat with the remaining dough, allowing the baking sheets to cool between batches. (Don't make too many cookies at once; they need to be shaped while still warm.) Serve with sorbet.
