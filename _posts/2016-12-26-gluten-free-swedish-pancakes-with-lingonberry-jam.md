# Ingredients

* 1 cup gluten free flour - I really, really like Krusteaz
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups milk
* 2 tbsp melted butter
* Lingonberry Jam

# Steps

1.  Add to blender jar flour, sugar, salt, eggs and milk and then give it a strong whir on Puree or another high setting.
2.  Put blender jar in fridge and let sit for 2 hours.
3.  Heat hot griddle or frying pan and then cook pancakes flipping once.  These are very, very thin and delicate and will cook almost instantly so keep a close eye on them.
4.  Serve with Lingonberry Jam.
