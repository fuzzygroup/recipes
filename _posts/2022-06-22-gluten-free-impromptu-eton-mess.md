This is very much an impromptu recipe -- I whipped it together from things on hand.

## Ingredients

* 1.5 large tubs of cool whip -- or an equivalent amount of whip cream.  This would ruin the fat free nature but, well, that's kind of joyful; fat free desserts are, after all, an oxymoron.
* 1 small package of vanilla pudding
* 4 ripe peaches diced / a container of strawberries / other fruit; if you use strawberries then macerate them with sugar first
* 1 8 ounce container of Trader Joe's meringue cookies

## Steps

1. In your stand mixer, add the cool whip, pudding mix.
2. Turn it on with the paddle attachment.
3. Add the meringue cookies and listen for that infinitely satisfying crunch as they get pulverized.
4. Turn off the mixer and fold in the peaches / fruit.
5. Let sit in fridge one hour before consuming if you can wait that long.
