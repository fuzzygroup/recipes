# Ingredients

* 2½	cups blanched almond flour
* ½	tsp baking soda
* ¼	tsp sea salt
* ⅛	tsp baking powder
* 3	tbsp butter, melted (or melted coconut oil)
* 1	tbsp pure honey (I prefer sage honey due to its mild flavor)
* 3	tbsp cultured buttermilk (or almond milk)
* 2	large eggs

# Steps 

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine almond flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder.
2.  In a small bowl, whisk together melted butter and honey, until smooth. Add the buttermilk and eggs, whisking together until well combined. Using a spoon, stir the wet mixture into the dry mixture until thoroughly combined.
3.  For quick and easy drop biscuits: Drop biscuit dough by large spoonfuls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, placing the biscuits approximately two-inches apart.
4.  For classic-style rolled-looking biscuits: Scoop a large spoonful of batter into your hands and roll into a ball about the size of an apricot. Then place the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet and gently flatten using the palm of your hand.
5.  Bake about 15 minutes, until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean. Serve warm with butter, raw honey or homemade jam.
