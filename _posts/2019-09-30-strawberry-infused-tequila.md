Apparently this is a delightful way to consume Tequila, particularly when you don't want the calories of Triple Sec (frightful).

# Ingredients

* 1 1500 ml bottle of Silver Tequila (I used 1800)
* 2 pints strawberries, washed and sliced with the greens removed
# Steps

1.  Place all the strawberries in a medium bowl and cover with the Tequila.
2.  Let rest for 6 hours then squeeze the juices out of the strawberries.  Then put the strawberries in a colander suspended over the bowl of Tequila and let them drip into the bowl.

As a pro tip you can also make the used strawberries into refrigerator Tequila Strawberry Jam.
