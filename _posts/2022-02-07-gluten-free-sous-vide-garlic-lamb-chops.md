## Ingredients

* 3 to 8 lamb chops
* 1 tbsp powdered garlic (or 1 tbsp minced garlic)
* kosher salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 tbsp olive oil

## Steps

**Note**: To start from frozen lamb chops, add 1 hour cooking time.  

1. Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic into a paste in a small bowl.
2. Coat lamb chops with paste and then add salt and pepper.
3. Put lamb chops into plastic bag and lower into water, removing air from the bag via the immersion method.
4. Set temperature to 137 and cook for 2 hours (with an Anova cooker the timer only starts once the water is up to temperature; no need to preheat).
5. Remove from water bath and sear in a hot pan for 1 minute per side.
