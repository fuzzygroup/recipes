My good friend David Mott has a thing for meatball subs -- and I mean a thing.  Here is the latest meatballs that I came up with for him.

# Ingredients

* 3 pounds ground beef
* 2 to 2 1/4 pounds ground pork (or diced pork ran thru a food processor to grind it)
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 4 eggs, beaten
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 minced onion; small as you can easily get it
* 1 cup gluten free bread crumbs
* 1 cup parmesan

# Steps

1. In a giant ass bowl or stock pot combine all ingredients in this order meat, everything except eggs.  Then add the eggs.
2. Roll into balls all the same size.  I like about 1" to 1 1/4" but it is up to you.  The bigger you make them the longer they take to cook.
3. Place on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.  You will need at least 3 trays for this amount of meat.
4. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes flipping them once so they brown evenly.
