Here's an extremely easy recipe for one of the most delicious drinks out there. This recipe is a slight variation on this recipe, found at www.wideopenspaces.com. Even going with mostly organic products for a finer resulting beverage, this is still a very inexpensive recipe. I would recommend sticking with organic at least for the juices, otherwise you're just not getting the same content. The final yield is about 14.5 pints / 1.8 gallons / almost 7 liters. Be sure to share several jars with friends, family and neighbors for that sweet real life karma, and also to not become an alcoholic. This is a great drink in the fall and winter times. Be advised, this goes down very smooth and the alcohol is nearly undetectable if done correctly, so be careful with this stuff.

# Ingredients

* 1 750ml bottle of 190 proof Everclear
* 2 Cups of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum
* 1 Quart of organic Apple Juice
* 1 Gallon of organic Unfiltered Apple Cider
* 3 Cups of organic Light Brown Sugar
* 1 Cup of White Sugar
* 7 Cinnamon Sticks
* 15 Pint-sized Mason jars
* A large stock pot

# Creating the Cider Mix (10 minutes):

1.  Add the apple juice, cider, and cinnamon sticks to the stock pot and bring to a very low boil, then add in the sugars. Stir slowly for about 7-10 minutes until all of the sugar is dissolved into the mix. Be sure to keep the sugar from staying along the bottom of the pot during this part. Turn off the heat and leave the cider mixture covered for several hours (if not overnight) to completely cool down to room temperature before you add in the alcohol (because some alcohol will evaporate if the mixture is still warm).
2.  Once it's completely cooled down, mix in the Everclear bottle and 2 cups of Captain Morgan. Then carefully transfer the contents into Mason jars, removing the cinnamon sticks, and put the jars into the fridge and keep refrigerated.
3. Now patience is the key. Every few days you should shake the contents of each bottle to really make it smooth. Wait AT LEAST a month before drinking or giving these out, but letting them stay longer just makes it smoother. I've read that some people drink them up to a year or more later. Some people drink it warm and serve in shots or small glasses.
