# Ingredients


* 1 1/2 pounds heirloom tomatoes, cut into large cubes

* 1 small white onion, finely diced (1 cup)

* 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus 1/2 cup leaves for garnish

* 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded if desired (for less heat) and finely chopped

* 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped

* 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

* Kosher salt

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds); I **strongly** recommend cutting these in half horizontally to speed cooking

* 1 cup shredded cheddar / monterey jack (about 4 ounces)

# Steps

1. Preheat the broiler. In a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish, toss the tomatoes, onion, chopped cilantro, jalapenos, and garlic with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Season with salt. Broil for about 3 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften and char. Remove from the broiler and stir the vegetables.

2. In a medium bowl, sprinkle the chicken with salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and toss to coat. Nestle the chicken into the tomato mixture and turn to coat. Broil for about 12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling and slightly charred on top.

3. Sprinkle the cheeses over the chicken. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese melts and begins to brown.

# Notes

None.
