You should understand that Reese's peanut butter cups come in three sizes:

* Regular
* Miniature
* Mini

What you want are Mini -- when you use Miniature, what happens to your bread is [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) where the too big peanut butter cups get dragged to the bottom of the bread.

## Ingredients

* 3 ripe bananas, mashed
* 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
* 1/4 cup Canola oil (Vegetable oil will also work)
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar packed
* 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 7.6 oz bag of Reese’s Mini cups

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Grease your loaf pan (I used an 9″ x 5″ loaf pan) with butter.
3. In a medium bowl whisk together your flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
4. In a large bowl stir together your bananas, peanut butter, oil, egg and sugars.
5. Pour your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Batter will be lumpy but try not to over mix or it will change the texture.
6. Gently fold in your Reese’s Mini cups and spread batter into prepared pan.
7. Bake for 30 minutes.  
8. Lower the oven temperature to 325 and cover it with tin foil.
9. Bake for 30 minutes longer or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. 
8. Let cool in pan for 10-15 minutes, then loosen the edges of the pan with a knife and remove from loaf pan, transferring bread to a cooling rack to cool completely before cutting into.
