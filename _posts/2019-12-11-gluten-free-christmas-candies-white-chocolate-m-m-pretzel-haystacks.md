## Ingredients

* 2 cups gluten-free small pretzels, broken into 1-inch pieces
* 1 cup salted dry-roasted peanuts
* 8 ounces white chocolate either morsels, baking discs or chopped white chocolate bars
* 1/2 cup mini M&M candies

## Steps

1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. 

2. Combine pretzels and peanuts in medium bowl. 

3. In microwave, melt white chocolate in glass bowl at 50% power (if you can find the setting; if not watch it carefully; it scorches).

4. Stir in melted white chocolate into bowl with pretzels and peanuts with rubber spatula.

5. Spoon tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle 4 or 5 M&Ms over each cluster. 

6. Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes, and serve. 

7. Once hardened, clusters can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
