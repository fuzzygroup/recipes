## Ingredients

### Filling

* 1 cup dried figs
* 1/2 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

### Dough

* 2 1/2 cups blanched almond flour
* 1/2 teaspoon celtic sea salt or just plain Kosher Salt
* 3/4 cup agave nectar
* 1/4 cup grapeseed oil
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Steps

### Filling

1. Put the figs into the food processor and process until smooth. 
2. Add the lemon juice and vanilla extract and process until smooth and paste-like. Set aside.

### Dough

1. To make the base: Super easy combine the almond flour, sea salt, agave nectar, molasses or yacon syrup, grape seed oil and vanilla extract.

2. Mix everything together and cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for at least an hour.

3. Put half the dough onto a silpat or parchment paper and roll between two layers of parchment or stack two silpats. Roll until 1/4" thick and 10" long X 4" wide. The size really depends on what you want your final cookies to be these are 2" wide bars.

4. Place into the freezer so the dough firms up and will be able to fold it over on top of the filling and the dough.

5. Put half the fig jam down on half of the dough keeping about 1/2" or more away from the sides.

6. Fold the dough over long ways so your dough is 2” x 10”and seal the edges with your fingers. Repeat steps 4-7 until all the dough is used.

7. Bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes depending on how dark you want them. 

8. Allow to cool slightly then cut the bars every 3” to form your fig bars

Makes 4 bars with dough rolled thin.  The Fig Bars keep for at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator and 3 days at room temperature.
