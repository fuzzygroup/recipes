* 2 cups amaretto (this is 1/2 the small bottle)
* Frozen Cranberries
* Cranberry Simple Syrup

## Steps

### Mimosas

1. In a large pitcher combine orange juice, vodka, amaretto and prosecco (you can also keep the prosecco separate and top each drink individually).
2. Pour into glasses with ice and stir in 1 1/2 tbsp simple syrup.
3. Top with frozen cranberries.

### Cranberry Simple Syrup from Leftover Cranberry Orange Relish

**Note 1**: This is a great way to kill off the cranberry sauce that is a required Thanksgiving staple but no one actually eats.

**Note 2**: This makes more of a paste than a syrup but it still works great.

#### Ingredients

1. 1 to 2 cups of the left over [cranberry orange relish](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/sauce/2016/12/29/gluten-free-cranberry-orange-relish.html) from Thanksgiving that no one eats besides you and maybe one other holiday guest.
2. 1/2 cup sugar to taste
3. 1 cup water

#### Steps

1. Bring all ingredients to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.
2. Let cool completely.  This is important; I didn't and got a nasty burn.
3. Process in a blender until smooth.
