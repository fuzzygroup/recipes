## Ingredients

* 1 cup self-rising flour (plus about 1/4 cup more to flour the kneading surface)
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1/2 cup milk (or buttermilk)

## Steps

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease a pie plate or small baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside. 
2. In a medium mixing bowl, add 1 cup flour. Add the mayonnaise and milk and stir gently until combined into a dough.
3. Spread the additional flour on the kneading surface. Dump the dough onto the prepared surface and gently fold the dough onto itself several times until it is no longer sticky. (Add more flour to the kneading surface, if necessary.) Avoid overworking the dough. 
4. Use your fingers or a rolling pin to gently flatten the dough to about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thickness. Cut into biscuits. Place the biscuits, sides touching, on the prepared pie plate or baking sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until golden brown. Yields about 6 biscuits, depending on circumference of cutting tool (I used a small mason jar).

**Note**: Baking powder and salt can be added to all-purpose flour to make at home a substitute for self-rising flour. The measurements are 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt for 1 cup of flour.
