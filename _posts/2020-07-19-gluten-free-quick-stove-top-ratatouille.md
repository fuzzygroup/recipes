## Ingredients

*  5 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for serving
*  1 1/2 pounds eggplant (1 large), large dice
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 1/2 pounds zucchini,  large dice
* 1 1/2 summer squash (3 to 4 medium squash), large dice
* 2 medium yellow onion, diced
* 4 cloves garlic minced
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 pound tomatoes (3 to 4 medium), large dice
* 1 large bell pepper, large dice
* 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced, plus more for serving
* 1 jar (32 oz) commercial marinara sauce such as tomato basil 

## Steps

1. Get all the vegetables prepped and separate into different bowls since you cook them separately and bring together at the end.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
3. Add the eggplant, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
4. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the pot. Add the zucchini, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the eggplant.
5. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the pot. Add the summer squash, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the eggplant.
6. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. 
7. Add the bell pepper and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
8. Add the garlic and bay leaf and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
9. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Add the reserved eggplant, zucchini and summer squash and gently stir to combine. 
9. Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours. A shorter cooking time will leave the vegetables in larger, more distinct pieces; longer cooking times will break the vegetables down into a silky stew.
10. Add the marinara sauce about 5 to 10 minutes before you want to be done cooking.
11. Remove the bay leaf. Just before serving, stir in the basil. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve, sprinkling each serving with more basil and drizzling with more olive oil.
