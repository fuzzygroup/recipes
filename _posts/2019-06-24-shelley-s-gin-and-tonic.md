A Gin and Tonic is one of those classic cocktails that can be as simple as ice, gin and some tonic or done better.  This is the better version.

# Ingredients

* 1 1/2 shots good Gin; either Bombay Sapphire or Hendricks
* Ice
* Lime Wedge
* Tonic Water to fill the glass (usually it is about 3.5 shots so use a tall glass); NOTE - if you don't specifically buy diet tonic water, it nowadays has sugar in it and you're getting a hell of a lot more calories than you expect.

# Steps

1.  In a tall glass, put ice.
2.  Add the Gin.
3.  Top with the Tonic.
4.  Squeeze the lime into the glass and then run the lime around the rim to ensure that every sip has a nice limey taste.
