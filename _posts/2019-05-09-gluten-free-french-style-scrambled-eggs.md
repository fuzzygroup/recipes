This is the best tasting way to make scrambled eggs that I have ever encountered.  It isn’t fast, it isn’t easy to clean up after but it is absolutely delicious.  These are good enough that every single time I serve them for dinner, no one, absolutely no one, objects.

# Ingredients

* 8 eggs
* 2 tbsp butter
* Pepper to taste
* Sea Salt to taste

# Steps

1. Take a pot that you can put a glass or metal bowl in the top of (to act as a double boiler) and fill it with hot tap water.
2. Put the pot on the stove and turn it to high.
3. Put the butter in the bowl and wait for it to melt.
4. Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper.
5. Add the eggs to the center of the bowl and begin moving them around to scramble them.  Keep them in pretty much constant motion (avoiding a steam burn around the edges of the double boiler) until they scramble into soft curds.  This will take at least 5 to 10 minutes.  Don’t get frustrated and give up - they are worth it.  They should be able to stand on their own and not be too terribly wet (honestly just taste them and you will know).
6. Serve immediately and season additionally as needed.
7. The bowl they cook in is going to be a pain in the ass to clean.  Fill it with water and soap right away and let it soak.  What the world really needs is a teflon mixing bowl but that simply doesn’t seem to exist.  Alas.
