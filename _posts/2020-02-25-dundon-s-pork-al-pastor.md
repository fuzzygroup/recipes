I got this recipe from a friend, Lexi, who got it from a friend, Dundon.  This is a slow cooker Pork al Pastor that is just plain delicious.  I rewrote the recipe to size it for an entire 8 to 9 pound pork shoulder.  And, please understand if you are doing it at that size then you will need **two** crock pots and you will need to split this between both of them

## Ingredients

* 8 to 9 pound pork shoulder, sliced into 3” chunks (remove the bone)
* 12 Guajillo Chiles, dried and whole
* 12 Ancho Chiles, dried and whole (note these aren't hot; they make it smoky).  If you can't find Ancho chiles then it is still lovely just with the Guajillo chiles.
* 1 7 oz can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
* 2 whole pineapples or 2 20oz can/container pineapple chunks
* 6 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 medium onions, diced
* 1/2 cup white vinegar
* 4 tbsp adobo seasoning
* 4 cups chicken stock

## Steps

1. Using a sharp knife remove the stem from each chile, slice open the chile, and scrape out all the seeds and loose flesh.
2. Dice each of the chiles into approximately 1” pieces. Place the diced chiles in a small sauce pan with two cups of water (or enough to just cover), and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until the chiles have softened. Drain the water.
3. If using whole pineapple, carve out the pineapple flesh and dice into 1” chunks. Reserve all the liquid possible, you should have at least a half cup. If you don’t, add water to the juice until you have ½ cup worth.
4. Add the chiles, chipotle peppers, half of the diced onion, the pineapple juice, vinegar, half the garlic, and adobo seasoning to a food processor. Puree for about two minutes or until the paste is smooth.
5. To both slow cookers, add the pork chunks. Cover with the chile paste and spread liberally across all of the chunks. Add the pineapple chunks and remaining garlic on top of the pork, then pour the chicken stock along the sides of the pork.
6. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. When the pork is cooked through, remove and shred using forks, then add back to the slow cooker and mix with the sauce.
