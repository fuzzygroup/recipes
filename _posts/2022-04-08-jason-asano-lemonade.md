I got this out of a fantasy series -- He Who Fights with Monsters -- where the lead character is named Jason Asano.  If you are curious, the link below is an online version to the first book.  It is, without question, the best lemonade I have ever made.  

**Note**: The author thought it was good enough that he has a sidebar where he gives the recipe.  And it is that good.

## Ingredients

* 6 lemons
* 1 1/4 Cups sugar
* 5 Cups water

## Steps

1.  Wash lemons until not waxy.
2.  Peel yellow zest from lemons
3.  Juice lemons and save juice for last step. 
4.  Cover lemon zest with sugar and sit for 12 hours or overnight. 
5.  Bring water to boil.
6.  Pour in lemon sugar mix. 
7.  Bring to boil.
8.  Strain and then let cool.
9.  Add lemon juice.  Serve over ice.
