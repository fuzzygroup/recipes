This is a follow up to my [original Horchata recipe](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/mexican/2019/07/29/gluten-free-homemade-horchata.html).  

# Ingredients

* 2 2/3 cups uncooked white long-grain rice
* 4 whole cinnamon sticks
* 10 cups water 
* 2 1/2 cup milk (I used 2%)
* 2 tbsp vanilla
* 1/2 cup + 1/3 cup Truvia sugar substitute

# Steps

1. Place the cinnamon sticks in a blender and essentially pulverize them.  Add the rice and blend until the rice and cinnamon sticks are roughly ground up (2 minutes).  Pour this into a nut milk strainer bag.  Place the bag in a large pitcher and add all the water.  
2. Let the rice mixture soak at room temperature at least 8 hours, or overnight.  
3. Once the rice mixture has soaked for at least 8 hours, remove the bag and squeeze it to get all the juice out.  
4. Stir in the milk, vanilla, and sugar, then chill ready to serve.  Serve over plenty of ice
