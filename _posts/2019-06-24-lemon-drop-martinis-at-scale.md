This is the party sized version where you are making it as a **premix** cocktail i.e. 8 lemon drops at a time.

# Ingredients

* 16 oz vodka
* 8 oz simple syrup
* 8 oz lemon juice, Kroger brand

# Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir.
2. Pour into a container; I use 1800 bottles because I always have them around.
3. Label it "Lisa's Giggle Juice".
