The best s'more I ever had was given to me by Adorable Cannon Fodder and served around a late night campfire.  It was ... fully optimized.  

# Ingredients

 * Chocolate graham crackers
 * Square marshmallows
 * Hershey's bars
 * Double stuff Oreo

# Steps

1. Find a late night campfire and sit around it shooting the breeze while mildly dazed and confused.  Bonus points if you can do it with people you are really fond of.
2. Toast the marshmallow.  Avoid burning yourself on the nuclear level heat that can emanate from a carefully tended campfire that burns for hours.
3. Drop that marshmallow on a stack of the other ingredients above and revel in the intense rush of chocolate fueled emotion.
4. Say Thank You Adorable Cannon Fodder.
