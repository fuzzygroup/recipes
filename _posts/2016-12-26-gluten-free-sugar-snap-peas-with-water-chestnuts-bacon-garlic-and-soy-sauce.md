# Ingredients
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 package sugar snap peas, 15 oz or approximate
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 can water chestnuts, sliced, 8 ounces
* 4 strips bacon, cooked and minced
* 2 tbsp light olive oil

# Steps

1.  Cut sugar snap peas in half (if desired).  Smash garlic and then mince it; keep garlic separate.  Dice water chestnuts and add to sugar snap peas.  Cook bacon separately and mince.
2.  Heat oil in wok until sizzling.
3.  Add sugar snap peas and water chestnuts to wok and cook for 5 minutes keeping in constant motion.  Add soy sauce while cooking so flavor infuses into the vegetables.
4.  Clear a center hole in the snap peas and add the garlic and bacon.  You want to immediately start moving the garlic around -- garlic burns if left still in a hot pan.  Cook for roughly 30 seconds until you can smell the garlic.
5.  Transfer to serving dish.  Getting it out of the pan stops the garlic from over cooking.
