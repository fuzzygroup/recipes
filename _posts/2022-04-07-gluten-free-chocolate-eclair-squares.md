## Ingredients

* 1 package (3.4 ounces) white chocolate instant pudding mix (this is the small box)
* 1 package (5.2 ounces) vanilla instant pudding mix (this is the large box)
* 1 3/4 cup cold milk for the white chocolate pudding
* 2 1/2 cup cold milk for the vanilla pudding
* 1/3 cup cold milk for the chocolate topping
* 1 tub (8 ounces) whipped topping, thawed
* 22 gluten free graham cracker sheets (this is usually 3 boxes of Pamela's gluten free graham crackers)
* 1 1/2 package (6 ounces) unsweetened chocolate
* 5 tbsp cup unsalted butter
* 1-3/4 cups confectioners’ sugar

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, whisk the vanilla pudding mix with 1-3/4 cups of the cold milk for 2 minutes. Fold in the thawed whipped topping until no white streaks remain. 
2. Layer 1/3 of the graham cracker sheets into the bottom of a 13×9-inch baking pan. You’ll use up about 7 of the sheets plus 1 additional square in each layer to fit the pan. (Don’t worry if some small gaps remain.)
3. Top with half of the filling mixture. Repeat the layers and finish off with the remaining graham crackers.
4. In a double boiler, combine the chocolate and butter until melted.  Add the confectioners’ sugar and remaining 1/3 cup milk and mix well.
5. Spread the chocolate layer over the top layer of graham crackers. Refrigerate 4 hours or until set.
