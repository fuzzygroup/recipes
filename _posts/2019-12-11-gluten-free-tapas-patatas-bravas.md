This was my introduction to Tapas and it blew my mind.  I mean, **Damn**.

## Ingredients

### Bravas Sauce

* 3 tablespoons of olive oil
* 2 tablespoons minced onion
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 tablespoons Spanish paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon Tabasco Sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
* 1/2 cup (4 fl. oz) Ketchup
* 1/2 cup (4 fl. oz) mayonnaise

### The Patatas (Potatoes)

* 4 large Russet potatoes, peeled, and cut to 1-inch cubes
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Chopped parsley, to garnish
* 1 cup (8 fl. oz) olive oil , for frying

## Steps

### Bravas Sauce

1. In a saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. 

2. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is soft.

3. Turn off the heat, and add the paprika, Tabasco sauce, and thyme, stirring well. 

4. Transfer to a bowl and add the ketchup and mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.

### The Patatas (Potatoes)

1. Sprinkle the potatoes lightly with salt and black pepper. In a large skillet fry the potatoes in 1 cup (8 fl. oz) olive oil until cooked through and golden-brown, stirring occasionally.

2.  (Take care when adding the potatoes to the saucepan because the oil will splatter due to the salt). 

3. Drain the potatoes on paper towels, check the seasoning, add more salt if necessary, and set it aside.

**Note**: Can also fry in deep fryer at 350.

### Getting it all together

1. Mix the potatoes with the sauce immediately before serving to ensure that the potatos retain their crispness. 

2.  Garnish with chopped parsley and serve warm.
