## Ingredients

### Marinade

* 1/2 cup Dijon mustard
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1 tsp [Scorpion Honey](https://metalhoney.com/)

### Chicken

* 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half horizontally
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 package (16 ounces) sliced fresh mushrooms
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Half a pack of pre-cooked bacon cut into 1" bits 
* 2 cups grated Monterey Jack and cheddar blend cheese

## Steps

1. Combine all the marinade ingredients. Remove and reserve 1/4 cup for serving.
2. Put the chicken into a plastic zipper bag. Add the marinade and allow to sit in the fridge at least 30 minutes or overnight.
3. Melt the butter and vegetable over medium-high heat in a frying pan.  Add the mushrooms and cook until they soften and begin to brown, about 6 minutes. Remove and set aside. 
4. Add the olive oil to the frying pan. Cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.  Don't crowd the pan too much; you likely have to do two batches.  (**Note**: because of the marinade, this will make an ungodly mess of the pan; SOAK it overnight before you try and clean it).  
5. Setup a metal or glass baking dish and put all the chicken breasts in it.  Top each chicken breast with some mushrooms, the bacon and the cheese. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in a preheated 400-degree F oven for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Serve with reserved marinade and extra Scorpion Honey on the side.

**Note**: You could also grill the chicken breast, then put them into a baking dish and top with remaining ingredients. Pop into the oven to melt the cheese.
