Classically you have hard boiled eggs or soft boiled eggs.  These, however, are in between or "squishy".  The best description might be *inside out fried eggs*.  For bonus points you can wrap these in bacon as a not quite scotch egg.

# Ingredients

* Eggs - leave eggs in fridge until you're entirely ready to put in the water

# Steps

1.  In a small pot bring water to a full rolling boil.
2.  Add eggs one by one to the boiling water with a spoon.
3.  Cook for exactly 7 minutes and then remove to cold running water (empty the pot and let the cold water run over the eggs).
4.  Peel and eat immediately.
