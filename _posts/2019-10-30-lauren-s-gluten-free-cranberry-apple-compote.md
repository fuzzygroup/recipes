I recently was part of a team offsite and my coworker Lauren made this.  It was a delicious topping to either fruit and yogurt or the Pumpkin Pecan pancakes that I made.  Thanks Lauren!

# Ingredients

* 2 apples, cored and diced with skin on (by preference)
* 1 bag cranberries
* 1 cup light maple syrup such as sugar free 
* Lemon and Cinnamon or Ginger to taste (Cinnamon is Lauren's standard but we didn't have any and used Ginger and it was actually delightful)

# Steps

1.  Core and dice the apple into rough chunks.
2.  In a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients except lemon and cinnamon / ginger.
3.  Cook over medium heat until most of the cranberries pop.
4.  Add the lemon and cinnamon / ginger to taste.
