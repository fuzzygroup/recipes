I don't write much about cooking here - I save recipes for my [recipe blog](http://fuzzygroup.github.io/recipes/) - but I'm particularly proud of this one - A Gluten Free Fettuccine Alfredo that is actually good.  My wife ate it and my sons inhaled it.  No one complained about the gluten free nature.  My wife suffers from celiac disease and really hasn't had pasta in the past 5 years now.  Yes there have been a few rice noodles when I made Pad Thai from scratch but pasta in the luxurious italian sense?  Nope.  

I ran across a [Fettuccine recipe in Cooks Country](http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/8991-fettuccine-with-butter-and-cheese?incode=MKSKZ00L0&ref=search_results_1) recently and thought "With the right noodle, my wife would adore that" and I came up with this.  Quantities have been adjusted to fit the noodles.

# The Recipe

The noodle I chose was[ Jovial's Tagliatelle](https://jovialfoods.com/product/egg-tagliatelle-gluten-free-brown-rice-pasta/) and it is excellent.  There's none of the grittiness / bitterness you all too often find in gluten free foods.  I suspect the reason it is so good is that it is an egg noodle and the lack of ingredients / extenders - Brown Rice Flour, Eggs.  That's it.  Highly, highly recommended.  

One final note -- when I made this I didn't cheap out and get low end cheese and butter.  Since these were the primary ingredients beyond the noodles, I sprung for the good stuff.  And it made a huge difference much to my surprise.  I used Kerry Gold butter and it was delightful.

### Ingredients

* 9 oz tagliatelle
* Salt
* 4 oz parmigiano-reggiano (2 cups, grated)
* 5 tbsp butter cut into 5 or more pieces

### Steps

1.  Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil (that's 12 cups) and add pasta and 1 tbsp salt to it once boiling.
2.  Cook for 11 minutes and then save 3/4 cup of the water in a measuring cup for the next stage.
3.  Drain pasta in colander and add back to pan.
4.  Turn heat to low and add water, butter and cheese and toss vigorously with tongs for 1 minute.
5.  Turn off heat and cover for 1 minute.  Add salt to taste and serve.
