This recipe was related orally to me by a former neighbor.  It is absolutely delicious, a snap to make and no child can resist it (my son Max recently ate 5 out of 6 chicken breasts done this way).  It is also a 4 ingredient meal.

# Ingredients
* Mayonaise (equal amount to amount of parmesan cheese)
* Parmesan Cheese (equal amount to amount of mayonaise)
* Gluten free bread crumbs italian flavor
* Chicken Breasts

# Steps

1.  Preheat oven to 425.
2.  Line rimmed baking sheet or metal baking pan with parchment paper or foil (to make cleanup easier).
3.  Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to ensure that they cook more evenly.
4.  Make a paste out of the mayonaise and parmesan (I use about 1 cup for 3 to 4 breasts; 6 to 8 halved breasts).
5.  Spread paste over the top of the breast.  It will be sticky but it makes a delicious topping.
6.  Sprinkle with gluten free bread crumbs.
7.  Bake at 425 for 30 to 35 minutes.
