This isn't really a recipe, it is a combination of two things:

* [Crack Pork](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/pork/2019/06/07/crack-pork.html)
* [Italian Pinto Beans](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/gluten_free/2017/08/24/italian-style-pinto-beans-with-basil-and-mozzarella.html)

What you do is take a bowl of the Italian Pinto Beans and top it with some of the crack pork.  This then becomes a surreal combination of food joy.
