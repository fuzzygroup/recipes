Ceviche made with stuff you get purely from the local Kroger supermarket can be surprisingly delicious.

# Ingredients

* 1/2 red onion very thinly sliced
* 1 pound fresh fish- sea bass, red snapper, corvina, tilapia, or hamachi – diced into ¾ inch cubes; I like tilapia personally
* 2-3 garlic cloves very finely minced ( use a garlic press)
* 1- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, start with 1, add more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 Cup fresh cilantro chopped
* 1 fresh jalapeño chili pepper seeded and very finely chopped
* 3/4 Cup fresh lime juice ( 4-6 limes) freshly squeezed; if you find the fish doesn't cure enough with 4 to 6 limes, you may need 8
* 1 cup grape or cherry tomatoes, cut in half  ( or 1 cup diced tomatoes)
* 1 T olive oil (optional)
* 1/2 to pound shrimp, diced into largish pieces
* 1 semi-firm Avocado- optional


# Steps

1.  Shop the day you want to serve this.  This is key; ceviche is best fresh (imho of course).
2.  Slice the red onion and salt generously and let stand 15 minutes until it begins to release its liquid. (this will removed some bitterness). Rinse well.
3.  Place fish, garlic, onion, salt, pepper,  fresh chili, and lime juice in a shallow serving bowl, gently mix, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. The longer you marinate the firmer the fish will become.  This is referred to as "curing" the fish.
4.  Before serving, add the fresh cilantro, shrimp and tomato and a drizzle of olive oil, gently mix. Taste for salt and add more if necessary. If adding avocado, gently fold it in at the end, after everything is mixed, making sure to use one that is not too soft.
