I got this recipe from Angie Gonzalez, a woman at the first church we ever attended in Indianapolis about a dozen years ago -- and it was wonderful then and is wonderful today.  Thanks Angie!

* 2 to 3 large tomatoes, preferably cored but that's optional / to your taste
* 1 large onion
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro to taste
* 1 to 2 diced jalapenos depending on hotness preferences
* Juice of 1 lime
* Salt

# Steps

1.  Chop tomato and onion to small chunks.  Add cilantro and finely chopped jalapenos.
2.  Squeeze the juice of the lime over the mixture and add salt to taste and toss lightly.
