My wife, Shelley, loves, loves, loves here Tequila and while these days she prefers a simple shot with Lime on the side, she also has a serious Margarita hankering and here is the Margarita that always blows her away.

# Ingredients

* 1 shot good Tequila (opinions vary but my wife likes 1800 Silver)
* 1 shot Orange Liquor (TripleSec, Patron Citron, etc)
* 1 shot Lime Juice (if bottled, buy the Kroger brand; not RealLime)

# Steps

1.  In a cocktail glass, put ice.
2.  Combine all ingredients.
3.  Stir.
