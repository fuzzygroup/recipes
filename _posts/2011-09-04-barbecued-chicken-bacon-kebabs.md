# Ingredients

NOTE: Review ketchup and molasses and mustard for gluten before serving as Gluten Free

## Sauce:

* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/4	cup light or mild molasses
* 2	T grated onion 
* 2	T Worcestershire sauce
* 2	T Dijon mustard
* 2	T cider vinegar
* 1	T light brown sugar

## Kebabs:

* 2	lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed of fat and cut into 1" cubes
* 2	tsp kosher salt
* 2	T sweet paprika
* 4	tsp sugar
* 2	tsp smoked paprika
* 2	slices bacon, cut into Â½" pieces
* 4	12" metal skewers

# Steps

1. FOR THE SAUCE: Bring all ingredients to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reaches ketchup-like consistency and is reduced to about 2 cup, 5-7 mins. Transfer 1/2 cup sauce to small bowl and set aside remaining sauce to serve with cooked chicken. 

2. FOR THE KEBABS: Toss chicken and salt in large bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 mins and up to 1 hour.

3. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal (4 1/2 quarts, about 75 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 mins. Arrange all coals in even layer over half of grill bottom, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 mins. Scrape grill clean with grill brush.

4. While grill heats, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Combine sweet paprika, sugar and smoked paprika in small bowl. Proces bacon in food processor until smooth paste forms, 30-45 seconds, scraping bowl down twice during processing.  Add bacon paste and spice mixture to chicken; mix with hands or rubber spatula until ingredients are thoroughly blended and chicken is completely coated.  Thread meat onto skewers, rolling or folding meat as necessary to maintain 1" cubes.

5. Place kebabs over coals and grill, turning one-quarter turn every 2-2 1/2 mins until well browned and slightly charred, 8 mins for breasts or 10 mins for thighs. (If flare-ups occur, slide kebabs to cool side of grill until fire dies down.) Brush top surface of kebabs with 1/4 cup sauce; flip and cook until sauce is brown in spots, about 1 min. Brush second side with remaining 1/4 cup sauce; flip and continue to cook until brown in spots and instant-read thermometer inserted in center of meat registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for thighs, about 1 min longer. Remove kebabs from grill and let rest for about 5 mins. Serve, passing reserve barbecue sauce separately. 

## GAS-GRILLED BARBECUED CHICKEN KEBABS:

Follow recipe for charcoal-grilled barbecue chicken kebabs through step 2. Turn all burners to high, close lid, and heat grill until hot, about 15 mins. Scrape cooking grate clean with grill brush. Leave primary burner on high and turn of other burners. Continue with recipe from step 4, placing kebabs over primary burner and grilling with lid down.
