This is simultaneously sweet and sour and absolutely delightful.  It is also referred to in my house hold as Lisa's Giggle Juice.

# Ingredients

 * 2 oz vodka
 * 1 oz simple syrup
 * 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice (this is 1 oz lemon juice or 1/2 the amount of vodka)
 * A wedge of lemon

# Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake to make it cold.
2. Take a wedge of lemon and go around the edge of a glass to dampen it.  Dip the glass in sugar to add a sugared rim.
3. Add ice to the glass taking care not to disturb the rim.
4. Fill with what's in the shaker.
