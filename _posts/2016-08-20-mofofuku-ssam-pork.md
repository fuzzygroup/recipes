One of the single best meals that any of us have ever had.  Here's the [original source](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12197-momofukus-bo-ssam).  There are several sauces that come with this but, honestly, they just aren't needed.  This pork is so delicious so it honestly is perfect all on its own.

At least for me I found that the default six hour time is too little and the underside of a particularly large pork roast doens't cook as well so you might either rotate it during cooking or cook it longer.  Next time I'm going to try 7 hours.

I'd also recommend cooking it with the fat cap on top so the rendered fat bastes it as it drips down.

# Ingredients


PORK BUTT:
* 1 whole bone-in pork butt or picnic ham (8 to 10 pounds)
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* 7 tablespoons brown sugar

GINGER-SCALLION SAUCE:
* 2 ½ cups thinly sliced scallions, both green and white parts
* ½ cup peeled, minced fresh ginger
* ¼ cup neutral oil (like grapeseed)
* 1 ½ teaspoons light soy sauce
* 1 scant teaspoon sherry vinegar
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

SSAM SAUCE:
* 2 tablespoons fermented bean-and-chili paste (ssamjang, available in many Asian markets, and online)
* 1 tablespoon chili paste (kochujang, available in many Asian markets, and online)
* ½ cup sherry vinegar
* ½ cup neutral oil (like grapeseed)

ACCOMPANIMENTS:
* 2 cups plain white rice, cooked
* 3 aheads bibb lettuce, leaves separated, washed and dried
* 1 dozen or more fresh oysters (optional)
* Kimchi (available in many Asian markets, and online)

# Steps

## PREPARATION

Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 300. Remove pork from refrigerator and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours (I'd recommend 7), or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, baste hourly with pan juices.) At this point, you may remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest for up to an hour.

Meanwhile, make the ginger-scallion sauce. In a large bowl, combine the scallions with the rest of the ingredients. Mix well and taste, adding salt if needed.

Make the ssam sauce. In a medium bowl, combine the chili pastes with the vinegar and oil, and mix well.

Prepare rice, wash lettuce and, if using, shuck the oysters. Put kimchi and sauces into serving bowls.

When your accompaniments are prepared and you are ready to serve the food, turn oven to 500. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.
