This is my canonical "chicken soup for when you're sick".  This batch I made for our neighbors Marnie and Brian with a batch of [roasted carrots](/recipes/side_dish/2017/03/10/gluten-free-havilah-s-roasted-carrots-with-changes-by-scott.html) for Brian who's apparently a carrot junkie.  You can really add almost anything to soups and a can of corn would be a logical addition if you like that sort of thing.

# Ingredients

* 1 Heavily Seasoned Chicken Breast from the Grill
* 1 Can Canned Chicken (large)
* 2 boxes swanson stock
* 2 onions diced
* 4 cloves garlic
* Frozen Bell Pepper
* Carrots sliced on the bias (diagonally)

# Steps 

1.  Take a large soup pot, preferably non stick but you can use anything and heat it up over medium heat.  
2.  Saute the onions, bell pepper and carrots for 4 to 5 minutes.
3.  Add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds, keeping it moving constantly.
4.  Add the stock.
5.  Add the chicken.
6.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes
