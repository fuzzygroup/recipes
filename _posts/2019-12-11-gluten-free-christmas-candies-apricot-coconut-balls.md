**Note**: This isn't my recipe; it is my wife's best friend's, Lisa Meece.  This is one of her treasured childhood recipes that she was gracious enough to allow me to share (and cook).  Thank you.

## Ingredients

* 12 ounces dried apricots; these are available in sulphured and unsulphured.  The sulphured retain their color and are what I'd recommend but make your own choice.
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk
* 4 cups sweetened coconut; I used Angel Flake
* Sugar or Colored sugar for coating

## Steps 

1. In a food processor, combine apricots and coconut and pulse until it comes together in a gluey paste.

2. In a standing mixer, combine the paste and the sweetened condensed milk until it comes together.

3. Roll into 3/4" size balls and dip into sugar.  

4. Refrigerate until firm.
