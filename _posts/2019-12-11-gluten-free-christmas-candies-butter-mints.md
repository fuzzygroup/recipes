title: Gluten Free Christmas Candies - Butter Mints
---
**Note**: This isn't my recipe; it is my wife's best friend's, Lisa Meece.  This is one of her treasured childhood recipes that she was gracious enough to allow me to share (and cook).  Thank you.

## Ingredients

* 4 tbsp butter softeneed
* 1/3 cup light corn syrup
* 1 tsp peppermint extract
* 1 pound powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* Food coloring, Red and Green

## Steps

1. In a standing mixer, blend butter, corn syrup, peppermint extract and salt.

2. Add sugar and blend until smooth.

3. Divide mixture into 3 parts.

4. Knead red food coloring into one part; green food coloring into the second and leave the third part plain.

5. Shape into round balls and flatten with a fork.

6. Let dry for several hours.

This makes about 6 dozen; that's a lot!
