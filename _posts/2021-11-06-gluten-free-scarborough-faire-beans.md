This isn't my recipe; it is my friend Lisa Meece's who whipped it up inspiredly for my wife.  I added it here since all the recipes I cook regularly are here.

## Ingredients

* 1 can of Cannelini or Great Northern beans
* 1/2 tsp fresh sage
* 1/2 tsp fresh rosemary
* 1/2 tsp fresh thyme
* A couple tablespoons of fresh Parsley, chopped
* 3 or 4 cloves of garlic diced
* chicken broth to cover the beans
* olive oil
* 3 tbsp parmesan (good; not Kraft)

## Steps

1. Dice garlic and Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme together
2. Put a bit of olive oil in the skillet. Add garlic and herbs and saute until it smells yummy.
3. Drain and rinse beans and add to the skillet. 
4. Pour in enough chicken broth to barely cover the beans.Cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened
5. Add fresh parsley and 3 tbsp  shredded parmesan cheese
