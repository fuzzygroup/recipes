This is an excellent potato dish that I recently served alongside Hoisin Salmon and a green salad.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds small Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled, halved (and by small I mean golfball size)
* 5 tbsp olive oil divided into 2 tbsp and 3 tbsp
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 4 tbsp finely chopped pepperoncini
* Zest of 1 lemon
* 4 tsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice
* 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tbsp dried parsley

## Steps

1. Turn oven to 400 degrees and set the oven rack to middle.  Spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray.
2. Toss potatoes, 2 tsp salt with 2 tbsp olive oil in bowl until well coated.  Place potatoes cut side down on the baking sheet and roast until bottoms of potatoes are golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.
3. In bowl you used to toss potatoes, combine pepperoncini, lemon zest, lemon juice, oregano and olive oil.
4. Add potatoes to mixture in bowl and toss.  Top with the dried parsley.  Serve warm.
