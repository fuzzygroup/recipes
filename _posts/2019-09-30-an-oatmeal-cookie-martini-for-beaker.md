I hang around the science fiction convention circuit (note - [StarBase Indy](https://www.starbaseindy.org/) is my favorite con) more than a bit and I've seen a lot of interesting cocktails.  I made this cocktail for my friend Beaker because he loves [oatmeal cookies](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/desert/2019/04/28/oatmeal-raisin-cookies-for-beaker-and-max.html).

# Equipment

* To make this easily you really, really need a [Nut Milk bag](https://www.amazon.com/Home-Premium-Food-Grade-Almond/dp/B00158U8DU/).  These are reusable bags that you can put the oatmeal in and then immerse in a container of vodka and it captures almost all the sediment that you would otherwise strain out with cheesecloth.
* A [metal coffee filter](https://www.amazon.com/ORIGINAL-GOLDTONE-Reusable-Basket-style-Coffee/dp/B0067NB5J4) gets the rest of the sediment.

# Step 1: Make Oatmeal Infused Vodka

## Ingredients

* 20 ounces vodka.
* 2 cups old fashioned rolled oats

## Steps

1. Add the oatmeal to the nut milk bag and put in a metal or glass bowl.
2. Pour the vodka over it.
3. Wait 24 hours and then squeeze the nut milk bag hard to get the vodka out.
4. Pass the vodka thru the metal strainer to capture the rest of the sediment.
5. Store the vodka in a large mason jar, the type used for moonshine.

# Step 2: Add Honey and Cinnamon

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups honey
* 2 sticks cinnamon

## Steps

1. Add the cinnamon and honey to the vodka.  
2. Shake and let sit overnight.
3. Discard the cinnamon stick.

# Step 3: Make the Cocktail

## Ingredients

* 1 or 2 shots of the Oatmeal Infused Vodka with the Honey and Cinnamon depending on how strong you want it 
* 1 shot apple juice

## Steps

1. Shake the container of Oatmeal Infused Vodka with the Honey and Cinnamon well.  The honey is thick and will sink to the bottom so shake it like you mean it!
2. In a glass combine ice, vodka and apple juice and stir.
3. Enjoy!
