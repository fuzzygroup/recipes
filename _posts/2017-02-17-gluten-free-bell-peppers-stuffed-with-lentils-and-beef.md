# Ingredients
* 4 Bell Peppers of Assorted Colors
* 1 Onion Minced
* 1/4 to 1/4 Poblano Pepper Minced
* 1 lb Ground Beef
* 1/4 Cup Gluten Free Bread Crumbs
* 1 Cup Cooked Lentils (I like pink but any type will work)
* 1/4 Cup Parmesan

# Steps

1.  Preheat Oven to 350 and boil a small pot of water.
2.  Core the bell peppers leaving their shape intact by cutting off the top and removing the seeds and ribs.
3.  In a small skillet saute the ground beef, onion and poblano pepper for 5 minutes until cooked.
4.  In a large bowl combine cooked lentils, ground beef, parmesan and bread crumbs.  Add salt & pepper to taste.
5.  Put the bell peppers into the boiling water for 5 minutes - pro tip - fill the bell peppers with water so they don't float around aimlessly and instead stand up like proper Bell Pepper Soldiers!
6.  Remove the bell peppers and dunk in cold water to so you can handle them.
7.  Stuff the bell peppers with the beef / lentil mixture.
8.  Cook at 350 for 45 minutes.
