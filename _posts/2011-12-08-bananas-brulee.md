# Ingredients

banana
sugar
cinnamon
blowtorch
vanilla ice cream

# Steps

Slice an unpeeled banana lengthwise. Coat the tops with sugar and a touch of cinnamon. Use a blowtorch to cook the coating just like you would for a creme brulee. Arrange the banana halves with the stem sections crossing. Add a generous scoop of vanilla gelato in the center, dust lightly with cinnamon, garnish with a cinnamon stick and perhaps a sprig of mint.

Voila. The cooked banana takes on a very custard-like texture and satisfies in the same way a creme brulee would, albeit with a different, more mellow flavor profile. Additionally, the presentation looks absolutely fantastic. I sometimes vary it up with a little caramel sauce instead.
The best part? The entire recipe can be completed in two minutes flat despite looking so impressive.
