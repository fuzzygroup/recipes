# Ingredients

	Note: Make up your own corn muffin mix with almond flour and corn meal if serving as gluten free. See delicious link for details.
1-½	cups prepared salsa
1	jalapeño pepper
2	15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1	8.5-oz. pkg. corn muffin mix (Jiffy is best AND cheap!)
2-½	tsp. chili powder
2	Tbsp. olive oil
½	cup sour cream
½	tsp. chili powder
Note: I usually omit the jalapeno because I don't like spicy food, either way I am sure you'll enjoy it.

# Steps

1.  In colander, drain 1/2 cup of the salsa. Seed and finely chop half of the jalapeño; thinly slice remaining half. In large bowl mash beans with vegetable masher or fork. Stir in muffin mix, drained salsa, 2-1/2 teaspoons chili powder, and chopped jalapeño.

2.  In 12-inch skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add four 1/2-cup mounds bean mixture to skillet. Flatten mounds with spatula to 3-1/2-inch-round cakes. Cook 3 minutes each side until browned. Remove from skillet. Repeat with remaining oil and bean mixture.

3.  In bowl combine sour cream and 1/2 teaspoon chili powder. Top cakes with remaining salsa, sliced jalapeño, and seasoned sour cream. Makes 4 (2-cake) servings.

The seasoned sour cream is AWESOME. I also sometimes add slices of avocado. Adds color and is super yummy....
