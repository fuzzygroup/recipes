My eldest son Alex's favorite meal in all the world is Hamburger Helper Stroganoff.  I recently figured out how to make a variant on this that he likes even better than what he's been eating all these years.  Enjoy!

## Ingredients

* 3 Boxes Hamburger Helper Stroganoff
* 3 pounds roasted turkey breast, cubed (I used a pre-cooked turkey breast from Costco)
* 2 1/4 cups hot water
* 6 3/4 cups milk 
* 3 tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup sour cream

## Steps

1.  In a large skillet place the water, milk, sauce mix from the packages and whisk until sauce mix is merged.
2. Add pasta and butter and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
4. Add cubed turkey breast at minute 7.
5. Add sour cream at very end.
