## Ingredients

### Roast

* 3 lbs chuck roast or rump roast
* 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt or 1 teaspoon regular salt
* 1 ½ teaspoons fresh ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 2 tablespoons olive oil or softened unsalted butter

### Gravy

* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons water
* salt and pepper to taste

## Steps - Roast

1. Preheat the Sous Vide Machine: Add water to the sous vide container or a large pot; set the Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 136°F (58°C).
* Season the Roast: Rub the roast on all sides with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
* In a small mixing bowl, whisk together garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper.
* Rub the roast on all sides with the seasoning mixture.
* Vacuum-seal the Roast: Vacuum seal it using “water displacement” technique: seal all but one corner of the bag. Slowly place it in the water bath, making sure everything below the zip-line is covered by water. Then seal the rest of the bag.
* Sous Vide Cook the Roast: Cook the chuck roast in the warm water bath for 24 hours. Arrange the bag so that meat is completely submerged in the water. If you use zip-lock bag, make sure the seam stays above the water.
* Cover with several pieces of aluminum foil, which will minimize water evaporation.
* When the timer goes off, remove the bag from the water bath. Don’t throw away the juices in the bag as we’ll use them to make the gravy.
* Sear the Roast: Remove the roast from the bag. Pat dry the surface thoroughly with paper towels. Place a skillet on medium-high, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the roast. Sear each side for about 1 minute or until nicely browned. Remove from the heat immediately.

## Steps - Gravy

1. In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water.
2. Place a skillet on the stove on medium-high heat, and pour the juices and browned drippings to the skillet. When it’s bubbly, add the cornstarch mixture, and stir with a wire whisk. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until the gravy is thickened. Season with salt, pepper if necessary.
3. Slice the roast against the grain using a sharp carving knife (making the slices about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick). Serve with the gravy.
