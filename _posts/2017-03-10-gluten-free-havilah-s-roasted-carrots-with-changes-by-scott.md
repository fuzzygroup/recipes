I've always loved raw carrots but never cooked until, at age 49, our neighbor Havilah fed me these at a dinner party and I finished them and then got seconds.  Then, when on the Whole 30 Hell Diet, I adopted them as a staple and learned to make them myself (hence the changes by Scott since I never got a recipe).

# Ingredients

* 4 to 5 whole carrots quartered lengthwise preferably organic (yes organize actually makes it better)
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Garlic powder
* Garlic Salt
* Salt
* Pepper

# Steps

1.  Preheat oven to 400.
2.  In a 9x11 roasting pan lay out the carrots.
3.  Drizzle with the olive oil and then shake the pan so they are actually coated.  1 tbsp is really all that's needed.
4.  Coat them with garlic powder, garlic salt, salt and pepper to your degree of preferred, salty love.  I treat it as a crust but your blood pressure may argue differently.  Shake them around to get the coating on all sides.
5.  Bake for 20 minutes.
6.  Serve and devour.  Even my wife, a carrot hating, would never give carrots to bugs bunny, person will eat these.
