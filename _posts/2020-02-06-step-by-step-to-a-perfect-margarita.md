I've been making margaritas for a long, long time but I've never actually written down the process.

**Note**: Margaritas are strong; eat first.

## Ingredients

* 1 shot tequila (I use 1800 silver)
* 1 shot orange liquor (I use triplesec but O2 is excellent and 2/3 the price of Grand Marnier, the best)
* 1 shot bottled lime juice (not Rose's) or the juice of one lime
* Kosher Salt

## Tools

* Small Shaker
* Shot Glass
* Small Plate for Salt
* Small bowl for dipping the rim of the glass in lime juice
* 3 to 4 cubes of ice

## Steps

1. Add to the shaker, one shot of tequila, one shot of orange liquor and one shot of lime juice (or the juice of the whole lime).  Shake well.
2. Put a little lime juice in the small bowl and dip the rim of the glass in it.
3. Put a flat pile of salt on the small plate and dip the rim of the glass in it.
4. Add the ice to the glass and fill with the contents of the shaker.
