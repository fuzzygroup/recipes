## Ingredients

* 12 apples, 6 honey crisp, 6 cortland, peeled and diced
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, divided
* Additional cinnamon for sprinkling over the top
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 cups light brown sugar
* 1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats
* 1/4 cup old fashioned oats for sprinkling on the top
* 1 1/2 cups gluten free flour
* 1 cup cold, unsalted butter, diced into small cubes
* Pinch of kosher salt

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.  Butter an 10x13 baking dish, or spray with non-stick cooking spray.  Set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, add chopped apples, granulated sugar, 1/2 tbsp of the cinnamon and lemon juice.  Stir to combine, then transfer to prepared baking dish.
3. In a separate mixing bowl, add topping ingredients (brown sugar, oats, flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, salt, and diced cold butter) and stir.
4. Transfer topping ingredients to a cuisinart and use the pulse button to merge the butter in until mixture resembled pea-sized crumbs or comes together.  Alternatively, you can use two forks or even your hands to cut butter into the mixture.
