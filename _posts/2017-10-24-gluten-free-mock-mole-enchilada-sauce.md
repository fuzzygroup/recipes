This started out as a variant on the sauce I use for my [chicken enchiladas](http://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/dinner/2016/12/23/gluten-free-chicken-enchiladas.html) but what began as a red sauce instead is now much, much more like a mole sauce.

Note: This makes quite a lot of sauce, enough for 2 or 3 pans of enchiladas.

# Ingredients


* 6 tbsp olive oil
* 6 tbsp masa (corn flour)
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp tsp garlic power
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1/3 cup canned, fire roasted, diced tomatoes, finely chopped
* 1 tsp vinegar
* 1 can diced green peppers, mild

# Steps

1. Heat the 3 tbsp olive oil for 2 minutes.
2. Add the dried spices and flour and cook for 1 minute stirring constantly.
3. Add the tomato paste with a whisk and cook for 2 minutes stirring constantly.
4. Add the chicken broth and diced green peppers and cook for 5 minutes.
5. Add the vinegar.
6. Pour over the top of enchiladas or use as a side dipping sauce.
