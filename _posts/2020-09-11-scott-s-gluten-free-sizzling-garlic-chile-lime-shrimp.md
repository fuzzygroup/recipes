This is an excellent way to cook shrimp as an add in protein to another dish like my Mexican or Mediterranean bowls.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds thawed shrimp
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil
* 1 tbsp Butter
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder or Minced Garlic
* 1 tsp Chile Powder
* 1 tsp Lime Juice
* Salt and Pepper to taste

## Steps

**Note**: With two pounds of shrimp unless you have a giant frying pan, you need to cook this in two batches.  A single batch of shrimp will steam not sear.

1. Preheat the pan with the olive oil and add the butter.
2. Add 1/2 the shrimp and 1/2 the seasonings and cook it until it sizzles and then move it to a plate.
3. Repeat with the remaining shrimp and seasonings.
