## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp peanut oil
* 2 tbsp honey
* 3/4 cup peanuts
* 4 sliced scallions
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp five spice powder
* 1 tsp balsamic vinegar

## Steps

1.  Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat. 

2.  Add 2 tablespoons honey, 3/4 cup peanuts, 4 sliced scallions and 1/2 teaspoon each red pepper flakes and five-spice powder. 

3. Cook, stirring, until glazed, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar and cook 1 minute. 

4. Transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet; season with salt and let cool.

5. Package into small jello shot containers **with lids**.  These have oil and are spicy so containers with tight fitting lids are essential or the other Christmas Candy you give out may get "scent contaminated" by these (this is why we only ever did these once; and they were quite tasty but not really Christmasy; still presented here for historical accuracy).
