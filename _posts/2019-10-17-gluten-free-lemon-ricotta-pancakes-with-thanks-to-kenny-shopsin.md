I adapted this, fairly shamelessly, from [Kenny Shopsin's amazing cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Me-Philosophy-Kenny-Shopsin/dp/0307264939/). If you don't have a copy of Kenny's book, I strongly, strongly recommend it.

These are probably the single best pancakes I've ever made.  I've referred to them as "The Pancakes of the Gods" and I don't think I'm exaggerating much.

# Ingredients

* 1 box Krusteaz Gluten Free Buttermilk Pancakes
* 2 cups cold water 
* 2/3 cup milk (if you run low on milk then substitute cream plus a bit of extra water)
* 2 eggs
* Zest of two lemons (preferably from a Microplane Grater / Zester)
* 3/4 cups Ricotta

# Steps

1.  In a standing mixer combine all ingredients.  Kenny argues for gently folding in the ricotta but I've always found that with ricotta you start by folding and then when it ends up lumpy, you just mix.

2.  Cook them on a griddle as you do normal pancakes.  Since these are gluten free you need to make them smaller than normal just because gluten free means you lack that wonderful, strong elastic protein that is gluten but if you are reading this then you likely already know that.  I recommend 1/4 cup of batter per pancake.
