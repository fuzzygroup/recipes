Yes the main ingredient is Zucchini and yes they actually taste like crab cakes (apparently crab cakes simply taste like Old Bay seasoning).

## Ingredients

* 3 cups shredded zucchini
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1.5 cup gluten free bread crumbs
* 1 egg
* 1 TBSP mayonnaise
* 1 TBSP Old Bay Seasoning
* ¼ cup Minced onion
* Fresh parsley if you have it
* Fresh black pepper

## Steps

1. Shred the zucchini in a food processor if at all possible.
2. Blend all ingredients using a stand mixer.
3. Pan fry in olive oil (or, better yet, dunk in a fryer for about 3 minutes at 356).
4. Serve with [remoulade sauce](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/appetizer/2020/09/11/gluten-free-remoulade-sauce.html).
