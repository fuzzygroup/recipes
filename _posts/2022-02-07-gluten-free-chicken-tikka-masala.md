## Ingredients

### Marinade
* 28 ounces boneless skinless thighs or breasts (thighs preferred)
* 1 cup plain yogurt or greek yogurt
* 1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp powdered ginger
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp tumeric
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground red chili powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil

### Sauce

* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 small onions or 1 large onion diced
* 1 1/2 tbsp garlic diced fine
* 1 tsp powdered ginger
* 1 1/2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp tumeric
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 14 oz tomato sauce
* 1/2 tsp ground red chili powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/4 cups heavy cream or evaporated milk (lower calories)
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1/4 cup water if needed
* 4 tbsp cilantro to garnish

## Steps

### Cooking the Chicken

1. In a bowl combine all ingredients for marinade and then add diced chicken and cover chicken in marinade.  Let sit for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight for even better results).
2. Heat oil in large skillet and fry chicken in 2 or three batches for 3 minutes on each side.  Do not crowd pan (and don't worry about the yogurt being stuck on the chicken; that's by design).  Set aside and keep warm.

### Cooking the Sauce

1. Melt the butter in the same pan and cook the onions for 3 minutes until soft.  Scrape up any brown bits on the bottom as you cook.
2. Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for one minute moving constantly.  Add garam masala, cumin, tumeric and coriander.  Fry for 20 seconds until fragrant while stirring.
3. Add in tomato sauce, chili powder and salt and then simmer for 15 minutes stirring until it thickens.
4. Stir in cream and sugar until well mixed.  Add in chicken and its juices and cook for 10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick and bubbling.  Add water if needed to thin the sauce.
5. Serve over rice.
