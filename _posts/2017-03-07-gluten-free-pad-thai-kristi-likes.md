This pad thai was made by me on 3/7/2017 and while my wife preferred an earlier, more "peanut buttery" version, her sister, Kristi, adored it and so here it is.

# Ingredients

* 2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 8 ounces pad thai rice noodles
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 medium lime)
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon fish sauce
* 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 3 green onions, sliced and separated into whites and greens
* 1/2 cup chopped, unsalted peanuts

# Steps

1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the noodles and cook for 5 minutes or until tender. Drain the noodles and set aside.
2. In a large wok cook the shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove to a large plate.
3.  In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and white part of the green onions and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until tender.
4.  Whisk the eggs lightly with a fork. Pour them into the skillet and cook just until they solidify, but are still moist, moving the eggs around the skillet slightly as they cook so that they lightly scramble. When the eggs are cooked, remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
5.  In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes. Add the noodles.  Pour the sauce into the skillet with the scrambled eggs and noodles and toss to coat in the sauce.
6.  Sprinkle the green onions, cilantro, and peanuts over the noodles. Toss lightly to combine. Serve warm.
