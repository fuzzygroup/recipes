# Ingredients

* 2	cups/14 ounces green, brown or black lentils, rinsed and picked over
* 1	small or ½ large onion, halved
* 3	garlic cloves, minced
* 1	bay leaf
* Salt
* ¼	cup red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar
* ⅓	cup extra-virgin olive oil
* ¼	cup broth from the lentils
* 3 to 4	ounces goat cheese (to taste), crumbled
* Black pepper
* ¼	cup minced chives or parsley, or both
* 2	cups wild or baby arugula

# Steps

1.  In a medium pot, combine lentils, onion, two of the garlic cloves and the bay leaf with 6 cups water. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Add salt to taste, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 25 minutes, until lentils are cooked through but still have some texture (they should not be mushy). Taste and adjust salt. Using tongs, remove onion and bay leaf. (You may cook lentils up to four days ahead and store in the refrigerator. Bring back to a simmer and proceed with recipe.)
2.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix together vinegar, remaining garlic, salt to taste and olive oil. Set aside.
3. Place a strainer over a bowl and carefully drain lentils, reserving 1/4 cup of the broth. 3.  Return lentils to the pot. Whisk reserved broth into the dressing, then stir dressing into lentils. Add goat cheese and stir until it has melted into the lentils. Season to taste with pepper. Stir in herbs.
4.  Line a platter, salad plates or wide bowls with arugula. Top arugula with the lentils. Serve warm.
