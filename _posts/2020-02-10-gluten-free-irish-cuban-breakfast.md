A good friend makes a delightful Cuban Breakfast with:

* rice
* black beans
* cilantro sauce
* avocado
* fried eggs

This is my Irish Cuban version of this using Potato Scones instead.

## Ingredients

* Fried eggs (1 to 2 per person)
* Potato scones (1 to 2 per person)
* Seasoned Black Beans (you can buy these at Kroger, canned where they sell the canned beans)
* Minced Cilantro

## Steps

1. Prepare the potato scones and then place them on a plate.
2. Fry the eggs and season them with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the black beans and then top the scone with several spoonfuls of the black beans.
4. Put the fried egg on top of the beans.
5. Add the cilantro.
6. Kiss the friend you made them for (yes it is that kind of breakfast meal).
