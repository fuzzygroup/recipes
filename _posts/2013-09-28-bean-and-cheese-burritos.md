# Ingredients

	Note: Gluten Free if Corn Tortillas Used
1	cup white rice
1¾	cups chicken broth
1	15 oz can refried beans
4	flour tortillas, burrito size
¼	cup sour cream
1	cup shredded cheddar cheese
½	head shredded romain (2 cups)
½	cup salsa

# Steps

1.  Preheat oven to 350.  In a small saucepan bring rice and broth to a boil over high.  Cover, reduce heat to low and cook 15 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and let stand covered 5 minutes; fluff rice with a fork.

2.  Meanwhile in another small saucepan, warm beans and 1/4 cup water over low, stirring occasionally.  Wrap tortillas in foil and place in oven to warm, about 10 minutes.

3.  To assemble, divide beans, sour cream, rice, cheese, lettuce and salsa among tortillas.  For each tortilla, fold side closed to you over filling, then fold right and left sides toward center; tightly roll up burrito.  Serve topped with more sour cream and salsa if desired.
