## Ingredients

* 1 package gluten free graham crackers (1 1/2 cups or 150 g; about 10 full sheets)
* 5 tbsp unsalted butter melted
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1 1/4 cups dulce de leche (either made by roasting a can of sweetened condensed milk or just use canned dulce de leche)
* 3 large bananas sliced
* 2 cups cold heavy cream
* 1/4 cup sugar (for the whipped cream)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Use a food processor to grind the graham crackers to crumbs.  In a standing mixer combine graham crackers, butter and sugar.  Press into the bottom of a pie pan and form a crust going across and up the sides.
3. Bake for 15 to 16 minutes and then cool for at least 15 minutes.
4. Pour the dulce de leche into the crust.
5. Top with the sliced bananas.
6. Make the whipped cream in a standing mixer with the cream, 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla.
7. Top with the whipped cream.

## Steps to Make Dulce De Leche

1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk in a pie dish.
2. Place the pie dish in a large roasting pan and place the roasting pan in the oven.
3. Fill the roasting pan with enough HOT water until it reaches halfway up the pie dish. This is exactly what we do when we bake cheesecake.
4. Loosely cover the pie dish with aluminum foil.
5. Heat oven to 350Â°F.
6. Bake until sweetened condensed milk has thickened and caramelized, about 2 hours. Add more hot water after 1 hour, since some of it has evaporated.
7. Let cool one hour.
