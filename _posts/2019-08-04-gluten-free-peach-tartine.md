# Ingredients
* 1 cup Ricotta
* 2 tbsp powdered sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 4 slices gluten free bread toasted (if you are serving to a mixed GF and non GF crowd then you want to use a crusty boule like a decent sourdough)
* Honey for drizzling
* 4 peaches, pitted and sliced horizontally - 1/2 to 1 peach per slice of bread depending on the size of the slice; GF bread runs smaller so you may need two slices to accommodate a full peach
# Steps
1.  Mix the ricotta, the sugar and the vanilla together.
2. Spread the ricotta mixture onto the bread.
3. Layer the peaches over the toasted bread / ricotta mixture.
4. Drizzle with honey.
5. Serve immediately.
