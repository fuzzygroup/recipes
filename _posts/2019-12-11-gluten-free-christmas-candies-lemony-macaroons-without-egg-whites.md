Coconut Macaroons can be made either **with** egg whites or **without** egg whites.  I've made my Macaroons without egg whites for years so this is my traditional approach if you don't want to bother with whipping egg whites.  I had mixed results with Macaroons with egg whites when I made them with this year which is why I am presenting this as an alternative.

## Ingredients

* Dash salt
* 1 can, 14 oz, sweetened condensed milk
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 2 packages (7 oz each) sweetened shredded coconut

## Steps

0. Preheat oven to 325.

1.  In a standing mixer, beat the sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice on high speed until thickened, about 3 minutes. 

2. Stir in salt, lemon zest, baking powder and coconut. 

3.  Drop mixture by rounded tablespoonfuls, 2 in. apart onto parchment paper-lined baking sheets.

4.  Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown.

5.  Cool on pans for 2 minutes.

6.  Remove to wire racks to cool.
