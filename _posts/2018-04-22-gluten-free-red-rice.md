I found this leafing through a cookbook at a used book sale, took a quick pic of it and sadly the book was gone when I went back for.  Alas since it is an absolute standout.

# Ingredients

* 1/4 to 1/2 pound bacon, diced
* 2 onions diced
* 2 cups long grain rice (you can use white or brown but if you use brown then increase the time from 20 minutes to 50 minuts in final step)
* 2 16 ounce cans diced tomatoes
* 1 cup water
* 2 tsp salt
* Cooked, diced chicken breast (or steak or pork chops or shrimp) (adding this at the end takes this from a side dish to a full meal); amount depends on preference

# Steps

1.  Cook bacon in a heavy frying pan until crisp.  Move to paper towel to drain.  Drain off all but 2 tbsp grease.
2.  Cook onion for 4 minutes or until tender.
3.  Add rice and stir until well coated with drippings and turns opaque.
4.  Add tomatoes, water and salt.  
5.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer covered until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (about 20 minutes).
6.  Crumble bacon over rice to serve.
7.  Add chicken breast or other protein.
