This is a great dipping sauce.  I served it on Tostones and Bacalitos and Grilled Shrimp.

# Ingredients

* 1 avocado
* 1 cup packed parsley and cilantro leaves (combined)
* 1 jalapeño, ribs and seeds removed
* 2 cloves garlic
* juice of one lime (or two – get lots of limey goodness in there!)
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup pistachios or walnuts

# Steps

1. Pulse all ingredients – except nuts – in a food processor until incorporated.
2. Add nuts and pulse until mostly smooth (depends on what consistency you want).
3. Serve as a dip, spread, or sauce — or add additional water or oil to thin the sauce for use as a dressing or a marinade.
