## Ingredients

* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts; if they are very thick then you may want to cut in half horizontally for portioning
* Salt and pepper (or seasoning) to taste; I advocate for garlic powder

## Steps

1. Set sous vide machine to 60C/140F.
2. Season chicken breasts lightly with salt or a seasoning of your choice. Place chicken in sous vide bag, and remove the air through a vacuum sealer or the displacement method.
3. Drop the bag in the bath for an hour and a half.
4. Remove bag from bath. Take chicken out of the bag, pat dry and season with salt and pepper (or seasoning) to taste.
5. Heat up large skillet on high and add oil. Sear chicken breasts for 60 seconds on each side, or until browned. Remove from pan, and place on a plate to rest for 5 minutes. Once rested, serve and enjoy!
