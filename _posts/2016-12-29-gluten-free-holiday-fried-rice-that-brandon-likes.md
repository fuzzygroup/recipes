Fried Rice is one of those meals that is always, always good.  I make a batch of fried rice and my family tends to fall on it like wolves.  The other night, for a post holiday get together, I put together a huge batch from holiday leftovers and it was gone, gone, gone by 9 pm.  There are three tricks with fried rice:

* Left over rice; you can't make rice the same day and then use it for fried rice.  It needs to have sat around for days and days and dried out to be good.
* Canned water chestnuts always add that asian feel to it
* Don't plan it -- you can incorporate almost anything into it.  Here are some examples from this batch:

  * I put into it a can of corn that we had forgotten to eat for Christmas dinner and found lying in the microwave the next day
  * I put into a chunks of prime rib from Christmas dinner; the bits you carve off the bone that aren't big enough to actually eat
  * I put into it a whole batch of Sugar Snap Peas with Bacon and Water Chestnuts that we didn't finish for Christmas dinner
  
Just go down your fridge shelf by shelf and say "Any chance that this gets better with some soy sauce?"  If the answer is yes then into the pot it goes!

# Ingredients

* 1 onion diced
* 1 bell pepper diced or frozen bell pepper that's been sitting around since apple season at the orchard
* 1 large can fire roasted diced green peppers, Hot

* 1 can corn
* 1 batch green onions minced

# Steps

1.  In a large wok add 2 tbsp oil and heat until sizzling.  Add the diced onion and bell pepper and cook 3 to 4 minutes until done.  Add the can of fire roasted diced peppers and cook for 1 additional minute.  Remove to large bowl.

2.  Add the sugar snap peas and cook until heated (in my case these were already cooked so I only did a minute). Remove to same large bowl.

3.  Add the can of corn and cook until heated.  Remove to same large bowl.

4.  Re-oil the wok and add the eggs and cook until scrambled. Remove to same large bowl.

5.  Add the prime rib and cook until heated.  Remove to same large bowl.

6.  Add the rice and break it up (it will be clumpy).  Add the soy sauce about a table spoon at a time and cook until heated and turns brown.

7.  Add back all the other ingredients and fold together.
