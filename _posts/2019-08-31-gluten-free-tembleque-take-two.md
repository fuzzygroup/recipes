This is my second pass at making Tembleque.  My first attempt ended up with an interesting texture (think solid pudding; sigh).  I was striving for something more like those jiggly white monsters from Doctor Who than a solid mass of pudding.  And no I can't remember their name but I think it starts with an A.

# Ingredients

* 2 cans full fat coconut milk
* Cinnamon to sprinkle on the top
* 2 tbsp Grand Marnier or Dekupyers O3 Orange Liquor
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp salt
* Toasted Coconut Flakes to top, about 3 tbsp (take coconut and put it on a cookie sheet under the broiler and watch it intently as it goes white to tan and get it out almost immediately)
* Ice Cream (in case this doesn't work; everyone likes ice cream)

# Steps

1.  Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in pan on stove and whisk together
2. Add coconut milk and orange liquor.
3. Bring to a simmer over medium high heat.
4. Cook for 5 minutes.
5. Pour into individual serving cups or ramekins.
6. Top with cinnamon and toasted coconut.
7. Let cool on counter for 2 hours and then move to fridge until ready to serve.

# Conclusion

After making this and letting it sit in the fridge overnight, it proved to be delicious.  I suspect it would have been just as good after only a few hours.  **Recommended**.
