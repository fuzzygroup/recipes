A friend in the Science Fiction convention space taught me this cocktail recipe from the 1920s.  Think flapper dresses and the Great Gatsby when you make one.

# Ingredients

* 2 oz Gin
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
* 3/4 oz Simple Syrup
* 2 oz Champagne or Proseco
* Long spiraled lemon twist or orange twist

# Steps

1.  In a shaker combine Gin, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, Ice and shake the hell out of it.
2.  Pour into a champagne flute and top with Champagne or Proseco.
