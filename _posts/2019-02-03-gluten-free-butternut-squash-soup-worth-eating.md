This is a delicious soup where the flavors are very much balanced out by the potato which "de-squashes the squash" in a very, very good way.

# Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion diced
* 1 carrot chopped
* 2 potatoes cubed
* 1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
* 32 to 48 ounces chicken stock
* 2 to 4 cups water
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Steps

1.  Melt the butter in a large pot and then add the olive oil, and cook the onion, carrot, potatoes, and squash 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Pour in enough of the chicken stock to cover vegetables.  You may need to add the water (or not; depends on the size of the squash).
2.  Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 40 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender. 
3.  Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return to pot, and mix in any remaining stock to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
