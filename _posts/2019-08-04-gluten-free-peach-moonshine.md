This is a recipe for a double batch which makes roughly 14 16 oz jars of Peach Moonshine.  As a non drinker, I have never tasted it but the folks who have seemed to adore it "Oh that's **good**."
# Ingredients

* 2  64- ounce white grape peach juice
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 8 ripe peaches peeled and quartered
* 6 whole cinnamon sticks
* 3 cups Everclear
* 1 cup cup peach schnapps

# Steps

1. Add juice, brown sugar, peaches and cinnamon sticks to a large pot.
2.  Bring to a low boil and boil 3 to 4 minutes or until brown sugar is dissolved.
3.  Allow to sit until cooler.
4.  Add Everclear and peach schnapps and stir.  
5. Remove the cinnamon sticks.
6. Place peaches in the bottom of each moonshine jar and add the moonshine.
7. Serve over ice with a garnish of peach and sprig of mint.
