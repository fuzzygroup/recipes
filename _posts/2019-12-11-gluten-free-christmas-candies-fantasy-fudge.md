## Ingredients

* 6 cups sugar
* 1 1/2 cups butter
* 1 1/3 cup evaporated milk; 10 ounces (yes this is about 2/3 of a can; throw the rest out or it sits in your bridge from Christmas until Valentine's day when you find it again and go "what was this from???")
* 14 ounce Marshmallow Creme (this is the large jar)
* 2 cups Chopped Walnuts or Pecans (or skip entirely if you're not a nut person)
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* 24 ounces of semi sweet chocolate, any variety (I used a combination of Nestle's chocolate chips; Bakers Brand and Ghirardelli bittersweet and it came out just fine)

## Steps

1. Line 11x13 pan with foil, extending over sides. 

2. Bring sugar, butter and evaporated milk to full rolling boil in 3-qt. saucepan on medium heat, stirring constantly. 

3. Cook 4 min. or until instant read themometer or candy thermometer reaches 234Â°F, stirring constantly. Remove from heat immediately (it comes together quickly at the very end).

4. Add chocolate and marshmallow creme; stir until melted. Add nuts and vanilla; mix well.

5. Pour into prepared pan; spread to cover bottom of pan. Cool completely. 

6. Use foil handles to lift fudge from pan before cutting into 1-inch squares.
