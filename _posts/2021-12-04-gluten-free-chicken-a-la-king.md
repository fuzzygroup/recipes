## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup salted butter
* 16 to 20 ounces mushrooms sliced; white or baby bella
* 1/2 cup gluten free flour
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 1/3 cup heavy creamy
* 1/2 can corn
* 2 cans (16 oz) chicken
* 1 cup chopped drained pimientos

## Steps

1. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add in mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.
2. Add in flour and stir until there are no more specks of flour left and mushrooms are coated. 
3. Pour in chicken broth and milk and cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes.
4. OPTIONAL: For a richer sauce: in a small mixing bowl, whisk together 2 egg yolks with heavy cream. Working quickly, slowly pour in 1/2 cup of the hot mixture into the egg mixture while whisking vigorously. Immediately pour this mixture back into the saucepan, whisking the entire time. Cook 2 minutes more.
5. Stir in frozen corn, drained pimientos, and cooked chicken and let heat through, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Serve hot over cooked rice, pasta, toast, or biscuits.
