I first made this just before Thanksgiving 2021 and gifted a half dozen to the local organizer of Starbase Indy.  She promptly renamed them "Love Muffins" much to my delight.  They are good enough that I don't see a future Thanksgiving or Christmas without them (just split a 32 ounce can of pumpkin and one pie and 12 cupcakes).

## Ingredients

* 2/3 cup gluten free flour
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice -or 3/4 tsp ginger and 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* dash of salt
* 1 can (15 ounces) pumpkin puree
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 3/4 cup evaporated milk

## Steps

1. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.
2. In another bowl combine the pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, vanilla and milk.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients until smooth.
4. Line a muffin tin with baking liners.
5. Fill each cup with about 1/3 cup of the batter.
6. Bake in a preheated 350-degree F oven for about 20 minutes. Cool slightly before removing and refrigerating until cold.

**Notes**: They puff up when baking but sink when they cool.
