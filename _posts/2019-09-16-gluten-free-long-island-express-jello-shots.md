We made these for my wife's birthday recently and they were apparently delicious although in the party hub bub, they got forgotten in the garage fridge.  Not to worry tho - they will get served at the next [Starbase Indy](https://www.starbaseindy.org) work night.

# Ingredients

* 8 ounces water
* 1 3 oz package lemon jello
* 1 oz vodka (but you could round it off to 2)

* 1 oz gin (but you could round it off to 2)
* 1 oz Triple Sec (but you could round it off to 2)
* 1 oz fresh lemon juice

# Steps

1. Bring the water to a boil on the stove.
