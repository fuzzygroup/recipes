I'm not a drinker at all so it is very, very rare that I'll come up with any type of original cocktail.  But, apparently, in a pinch, I can do this (even if I'll never, ever taste it). What inspired this is on a camping trip, a fellow camper nicked my bottle of [Lisa's Giggle Juice](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/cocktail/2019/06/24/lemon-drop-martini.html),and I came up with this now forever known as Lisa's Elation Elixir.  The Lisa in question is Lisa Meece who runs [StarBase Indy](https://www.starbaseindy.org/), a local science fiction and STEM convention and who happened to be camping in the next tent over.

This is not a heavy alcohol drink as Lisa doesn't like drinks that are too strong.

# Ingredients

* 2 large shots pineapple juice
* 1 small shot vodka
* 1 small shot O2 (O2 is a high end orange liquor; if you don't have O2 then substitute Grand Marnier or Patron Citron)

# Steps

1.  In a cocktail glass, put ice.
2.  Combine all ingredients.
3.  Stir.
