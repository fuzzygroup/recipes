## Ingredients
* 1 tri tip roast 
* 1 (2 and 1/2 pound) tri tip roast
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
* 1 tablespoon Lawry's seasoning salt -or- Prime Rib Seasoning Mix
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 
## Steps

1. In a small bowl, combine all the spices: galic salt, seasoning salt, kosher salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder, and parsley. 
2. Rub the spice mixture all over the roast with your hands. Place in a large ziplock bag and add 1/4 cup olive oil. Seal the bag and massage the oil into the meat. Place in the fridge and marinate, turning a couple times, for about 8 hours.  The longer the better, up to 3 days.
3. Place the roast on a plate and discard the marinade (or save it to add to a pan sauce if you plan to make one).
4. Remove the meat from the fridge 30 minutes before you plan to cook it. It should start cooking at room temperature.
5. Preheat your grill to high heat. Make sure you give it a good 15-20 minutes to heat up.
6. Sear the roast over high heat for about 2-3 minutes, until it is nicely browned. Flip over (grease again if necessary) and sear the other side for 2-3 minutes. Keep the lid shut as much as you can.
7. Turn off the heat on the side of the grill that your meat is on. We are cooking it over INDIRECT heat. Lower the other side of the grill to low heat. If you are cooking over charcoals, arrange the meat and charcoals so that the meat is off to the side, not cooking directly above the charcoal. 
8. Grill without opening the lid for about 20-25 minutes, or about 10-15 minutes per pound, depending on how rare you want it. Rare is 135 degrees F. Medium rare is 145 degrees F. Use a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the roast to check the temperature.
9. Remove the roast from the grill, and place on a rimmed platter. Cover well with foil and let rest for 10-15 minutes.
