This is the party sized version where you are making it as a **premix** cocktail i.e. a literal bottle of Margaritas.

# Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups lime juice
* 3 cups Tequila
* 3 cups Triple Sec
 
# Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir.
2. Pour into a container; I use 1800 bottles because I always have them around.
3. Label it "Shiny's Margarita".
