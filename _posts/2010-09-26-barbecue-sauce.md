# Steps

0.  This recipe is already doubled so it makes a lot.

1.  Heat the oil in a stock pot over medium heat.

2.  Reduce heat to medium and add the onions, shallots and garlic.  Gently saute for about 10 minutes until tender and golden.

3.  Add the tomato sauce, molasses, brown sugar, orange juice, worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.  Mix well and bring to a boil.

4. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes stirring until slightly thickened and reduced by half.

5.  Optional.  Pour sauce through a strainer to remove solids.  Press solids against a spoon to extract sauce.  Discard solids and put sauce into a sealed container.
