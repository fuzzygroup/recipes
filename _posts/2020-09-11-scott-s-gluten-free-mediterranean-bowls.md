This is a recipe that I came up with after having a similar dish in a Mediterranean take out dish on a crazy road trip to Detroit to visit [John King Books](https://www.johnkingbooksdetroit.com/).  This is a recipe but, honestly, it is more like jazz improv.  You can make this from lots of ingredients you have on hand.  The basic idea is a starch (rice), a protein (anything) and then Mediterranean flavored vegetables / "whatever" served in a layered bowl.  This is the way I initially made it but what you do will likely vary.

## Ingredients

* Spanish Rice
* Diced white onion
* Diced tomatoes
* Diced bell pepper
* Shredded Lettuce
* Garbanzo beans
* Diced Dill Pickles
* Garlic Yogurt Sauce
* Tahini (optional)
* A protein (I used sliced Rib Eye steak that I had cooked the night before) but steak / chicken / shrimp / gyro meat

## Steps

1. Take serving bowls for each person you are feeding and line them up in a row.
2. Start by putting a layer of rice at the base.
3. Add beans (1/2 can per bowl) spreading them in a layer across the rice.
4. Add the vegetables, again in layers (save the fresh tomatoes for AFTER the bowl has been heated).
5. Add the protein.
6. Heat the bowl in the microwave (my assumption is that you are building this from leftovers).
7. Add the diced pickles, lettuce, garlic sauce and tahini.  
8. Top with the garlic yogurt sauce.
