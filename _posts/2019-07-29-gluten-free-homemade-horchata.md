A recent bout of acid reflux has me looking to convert by diet from acidic to basic and while I suspected Horchata might play a role, I was delighted to have this actually confirmed [here](https://alanferch.wordpress.com/2016/06/07/horchata-why-i-love-this-mexican-drink-and-why-you-should-too/).  And since one random guy on the Internet has now confirmed this for me, well, **grin**.  And, not surprisingly, Horchata you make yourself is way, way, way better than what you get from a Horchata mix that the two are not from the same planet.  I choked down the mix stuff thinking it would be good for me; the home version I **guzzled**.

This is a recipe for a double batch.

# Ingredients

* 2 2/3 cups uncooked white long-grain rice
* 4 whole cinnamon sticks
* 8 cups water in two four cup measuring cups
* 2 cup milk (I used 2%)
* 1 1/3 tbsp vanilla
* 1 cup granulated sugar (I'm going to try a low cal sweetener soon but haven't yet)

# Steps

1. Combine the rice, cinnamon sticks, and 4 cups of the water in a blender.  Blend until the rice and cinnamon sticks are roughly ground up (2 minutes).  Add as much of the remaining water as will fit and blend again.  If all the water won't fit then transfer to a large bowl.
2. Let the rice mixture soak at room temperature at least 8 hours, or overnight.  
3. Once the rice mixture has soaked for at least 8 hours, pour through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher.  Discard the rice and cinnamon stick solids and rinse the strainer well.  Strain the mixture again one more time, just to make sure the horchata isn't gritty. 
4. Stir in the milk, vanilla, and sugar, then chill ready to serve.  Serve over plenty of ice
