# Ingredients

* 1 can pinto beans, 16 oz, drained and rinsed
* 1 1/2 cup basil leaves, finely chopped
* 2 anchovy filets, rinsed and finely chopped
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 1/2 garlic cloves finely chopped
* 1/4 cup olive oil + 2 tbsp 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2/3 cups chicken stock
* 3 tbsp shredded parmesan
* 1 large ball mozzarella, chopped

# Steps

1. Make a sauce by combining the basil, anchovies, dijon mustard, garlic, 1/4 cup olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.
2. Add the beans to a sauce pan with the chicken stock and 2 tbsp olive oil.  Bring to a simmer and then add 1/2 of the sauce from step 1.
3. Cook until liquid thickens and beans are heated through, about 2 minutes.
4. Add the rest of the sauce, the parmesan and the mozzarella and stir to blend together.

See note #2 below to make this even better.

# Notes

1. This was based on a Wall Street Journal recipe "Borlotti Beans with Mozzarella and Salsa Verde".
2. To make this even more delicious, serve it in a bowl with bits of [Momofuku Ssam Pork](http://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/pork/2016/08/20/mofofuku-ssam-pork.html) added.
