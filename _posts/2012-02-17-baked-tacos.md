# Ingredients

1	lb. ground beef
1	package (1.25 oz) taco seasoning mix
1	c. (4 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
2	tbs water
2	8-oz packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1	medium green bell pepper
1	c. salsa (optional)
3	c. lettuce, shredded (we used more — ¾ a head)
1	medium tomato, diced
¼	c. onion, chopped
½	c. pitted ripe olives
sour cream

# Steps

–Preheat oven to 375°. Brown the ground beef, then drain. Add taco season and simer
–Unroll the crescent dough; separate into triangles. Arrange triangles in a circle on a pizza pan with the wide ends toward the center of the pan, overlapping each other. It will look like a large sun with the points hanging half off the pan. There should be a 5 or 6 inch opening in the center.
–Spoon the meat mixture evenly onto widest end of each triangle. Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under wide ends of dough. (Filling will not be completely covered).
–Bake 18-22 minutes or until golden brown.
–Shred lettuce, dice tomato, onions, olives, green pepper, and whatever other items you want to put inside. Place them in center of the taco ring and use that as your toppings!
– Tada! Now enjoy & don’t eat to much 


(Summary -- think of this less as a ring as more as taco turnovers arranged in a ring shape and its easier)
