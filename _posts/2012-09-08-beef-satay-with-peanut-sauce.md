# Steps

Beef Satay Directions

1.  Cut the steak in half lengthwise and freeze for 30 minutes.
2.  Combine soy sauce, oil, chili sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, garlic and scallions in measuring cup and set aside. 
3.  Remove the steak from freezer and slice each piece across the grain into 1/4" thick strips.  Weave the meat onto the skewers.  Dunk the meat end of each skewer into the marinade to coat.  Lay the skewers in a shallow dish propping up the exposed end of the skewers to keep them clean.  Pour the remaining marinate over the meat.  Refrigerate for exactly 1 hour.
4.  Adjust an oven rack to the top position and heat the broiler.  Lay the skewers on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and cover the skewer ends with foil.  
5.  Broil for 6 to 7 minutes, flipping half way through until browned.  Serve immediately with the peanut sauce.
