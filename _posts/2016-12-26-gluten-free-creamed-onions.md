Note: We generally make this at the holidays so it is sized for a giant meal.  You really, really may want to scale it down.

# Ingredients

* 4 bags frozen pearl onions
* 1 container chicken broth, 32 oz
* 1/4 cup dry sherry
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 cup whole milk or 2%
* 1 cup heavy cream
* salt and pepper
* 1/4 cup minced fresh chives
* Pinch nutmeg
* Dash sriracha

# Steps

1.  Bring onions, broth, sherry and bayleaf to boil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until liquid evaporates, 12 to 15 minutes; I often just cook this for the first 15 minutes because it seems to take **forever** to evaporate.  In this case then simply drain away the chicken broth with a colander.

2.  Whisk cornstarch and 2 tbsp milk together in small bowl until combined.  Stir cream, remaining milk, cornstarch mixture, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper into onions and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium low and cook stirring occasionally until sauce is thickened and onions are tender when pierced with tip of paring knife, 8 to 10 minutes.

3.  Off heat stir in chives, nutmeg and a dash sriracha.  Remove bay leaf.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving bowl.
