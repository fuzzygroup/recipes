## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
* 8 cloves garlic or 1 to 2 tbsp garlic powder to taste
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp olive oil

## Steps

1. Mash garlic into a paste (salt helps to add a little traction to the garlic and makes it easier to mash).
2. Mix well into yogurt then add remaining ingredients. 
3. Ideally chill for at least 3 hours before serving but I've made it and served it with no delay and it was lovely.
