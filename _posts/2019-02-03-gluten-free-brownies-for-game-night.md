I recently found myself at Lisa Meece's house for a wonderful night of board gaming (thank you Miss Lisa).  Prior to the evening starting, a Facebook message called out the need for desserts and I tossed these together on a whim.

# Ingredients


* 1 stick butter cut into chunks
* 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate (yes it must be unsweetened)

* 1 cup sugar
* 2 large eggs (oh hell just 2 damn eggs)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (overflowing is best)
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 2/3 cups gluten free flour (1:1 replacement style such as King Arthur or Bob's Red Mill)
* Confectioners sugar to put over the top of the brownies

# Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 with rack in middle position. I used a baking steel underneath the pan but that's likely not necessary.
2. In mixing cup or small bowl combine butter and chocolate and microwave at 50% power until melted.
3. In stand mixer combine all other ingredients (except confectioners sugar) and mix well.
4. Add chocolate and butter.
5. Line 8x8 pan with tinfoil and make a sling to lift them out.
6. Coat tinfoil with non stick spray.
7. Bake at 350 for 22 to 27 minutes.
8. Let cool and then sprinkle with the confectioners sugar.  Use the colander / wire mesh trick to get it on there evenly without clumping.
9. Accept accolades from gluten free people who generally lack decent baked goods.
