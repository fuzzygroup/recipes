This is a recipe but, honestly, it is more like jazz improv.  You can make this from lots of ingredients you have on hand.  The basic idea is a starch (rice), a protein (anything) and then mexican flavored vegetables / "whatever".  This is the way I initially made it but what you do will likely vary.

## Ingredients

* A cooked starch like Spanish Rice (or white rice; whatever you have on hand); I have a recipe for this
* A cooked protein like Shrimp, Chicken, Taco Meat, Carnitas, etc shredded into bite size pieces (I used [Scott's Sizzling Garlic Chile Lime Shrimp](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/mexican/2020/09/11/scott-s-gluten-free-sizzling-garlic-chile-lime-shrimp.html) once to great acclaim)
* A can of beans like pinto beans or black beans or great northern beans (use one can per every two bowls you are making)
* Diced onion
* Diced peppers like poblano / jalapeno / banana
* Left over cooked veggies from [Salsa Chicken](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/mexican/2016/07/11/chicken-with-ranchera-salsa.html) if you happened to just make it
* Grilled corn (one ear per bowl)
* Diced fresh tomatoes
* Fresh cilantro chopped
* Shredded mexican cheese mix to top the bowl
* Sour Cream to top the bowl

## Steps

1. Take serving bowls for each person you are feeding and line them up in a row.
2. Start by putting a layer of rice at the base.
3. Add beans (1/2 can per bowl) spreading them in a layer across the rice.
4. Add the grilled corn as a layer.
5. Add the vegetables, again in layers (save the fresh tomatoes and cilantro for AFTER the bowl has been heated).
6. Add the protein.
7. Heat the bowl in the microwave (my assumption is that you are building this from leftovers).
8. Add the tomatoes and cilantro.  
9. Top with cheese and sour cream (if desired).
