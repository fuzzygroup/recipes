This can be started in mid-afternoon and served the same night but don't ask me why it works.

# Ingredients

* Any size rib roast of beef
* Salt & Pepper -- no flour
* Garlic powder

# Steps

1.  Place beef in roasting pan, uncovered and put in 375 oven for 1 hour.
2.  Salt, pepper and garlic powder the beef to your liking.
3.  Turn off the oven but DO NOT open the oven door at all.
4.  For rare roast beef, 45 minutes before serving time, turn oven to 300.
5.  For medium roast beef, 50 minutes before serving time, turn oven to 300.
6.  For medium well done roast beef, 55 minutes before serving time, turn oven to 300.

That's all!  Don't peek.
