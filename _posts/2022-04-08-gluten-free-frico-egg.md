## Ingredients

* 1 egg cracked into a ramekin or teacup
* Small amount of shredded cheddar or parmesan (basically shredded hardish cheese) (maybe two to three tablespoons)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Good non stick pan or cast iron that is well seasoned

## Steps

Note: This is more a technique than a recipe.  

1.  Put pan over medium heat and warm the pan nicely.
2.  Add a thin layer of cheese roughly the size of the egg.
3.  Wait for the cheese to bubble and melt.
4.  Pour the egg over the cheese disc.  Cook the egg gently, adding salt and pepper as it starts to fry.
5.  You may need to cover the pan to get the egg to cook thoroughly.  Patience is key.
