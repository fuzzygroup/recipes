At a dear friend's birthday party we recently made these over and over.  For a summery drink where you aren't looking for a serious alcohol experience but something light and refreshing, it is hard to beat a mojito.

# Ingredients

* 1 shot plain -or- coconut rum
* 6 fresh mint leaves (preferably home grown and picked about 10 minutes before making the drink)
* 2 tbsp sugar
* Club Soda
* Mortar and Pestle for muddling

# Steps

1.  In a tall glass, put ice.
2.  Add mint leaves to mortar.  Add sugar on top of it.  Muddle the sugar with the mint.
3.  Add the muddled sugar and mint to the glass with ice.
4.  Add the shot of rum to the mortar to wash the sugar residue clean and pour it into the glass.
5.  If mortar is clean then add the club soda right to the glass; otherwise add some club soda to the mortar and then pour it into the glass.  Top iwth remaining club soda.  
6.  Stir.
