## Ingredients

* 3.5 to 4 point boneless pork butt, fat cap trimmed to 1/4" thick, cut into 2" chunks
* 1 small onion peeled and halved 
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* salt and pepper
* 2 cups water
* 2 tbsp juice from one lime
* 1 large orange halved


## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 300 and set an oven rack to the lower middle position.
2. Combine the pork, onion, bay leaves, oregano, cumin, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, water and lime juice in a large dutch oven.  The liquid should barely cover the meat.  Juice the orange and add the orange and the halves to the pot.  Bring to a simmer over medium high heat, stirring occasionally. 
3. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the pork is soft and falls apart when prodded with a fork, about 2 hours.  Flip the pieces of meat once during cooking.
4.  Remove the pot from the oven and set the oven to broil.  Using a slotted spoon transfer the pork to a bowl; remove the orange halves, onion and bay leaves and discard.  Place the pot over high head and simmer, stirring frequently until thick and syrupy (a heat proof spatula will leave a long trail), about 8 to 12 minutes.  You should have one cup at the end.
5.  Using two forks, pull each piece of pork in half.  Fold in the reduced liquid.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread over a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet.  Place in the oven and broil until well browned but not charred, 5 to 8 minutes.  Flip the meat and continue to broil, 5 to 8 minutes.
