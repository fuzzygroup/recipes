## Ingredients

* 1½ tablespoons plus 1½ cups water, divided
* 1 teaspoon table salt, divided
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 pound 85 percent lean ground beef
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 8 ounces (2 cups) elbow macaroni
* 1 cup whole milk
* 8 ounces American cheese, chopped (2 cups), divided
* 8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups), divided
* 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, plus extra for serving
* 1/4 cup finely chopped dill pickles, plus extra for serving
* 2 tablespoons ketchup

## Steps

1. Stir 1½ tablespoons water, ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, and baking soda in medium bowl until baking soda and salt are dissolved. Add beef and mix until thoroughly combined. Let sit for 15 minutes.
2. Heat oil in 12-inch broiler-safe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
3. Add macaroni, milk, and remaining 1½ cups water and bring to simmer. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low; and cook until macaroni is al dente, about 5 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking.
4. Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Stir 1½ cups American cheese, 1½ cups cheddar, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt into macaroni until fully combined and cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
5. Off heat, sprinkle remaining ½ cup American cheese and remaining ½ cup cheddar over top of macaroni. Broil until spotty brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with extra onion and pickles. Serve.
