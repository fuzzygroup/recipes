This is, without question, one of the greatest deserts you will ever consume.  It is based on David Chang's Momofuku Crack Pie and I did my variant based on [Fire and Salt](http://fireandsalt.blogspot.com/2010/09/gluten-free-crack-pie.html).  Here's how good this -- never once has this pie NOT been consumed in one sitting whether it was made for 2 people, 3 people or 5 people.  

# Ingredients

## Ingredients Crust Stage 1

* 6 Tbs salted butter at room temperature
* 4 Tbs brown sugar
* 2 Tbs granulated sugar
* 1 egg
* 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbs GF oats; Bob's Red Mill is excellent
* 1/2 cup GF flour mix; I used Krusteaz which is my current favorite
* 1/8 tsp baking powder
* 1/8 tsp baking soda
* heaping 1/4 tsp salt

## Ingredients Crust Stage 3

* Oat cookie from stage one cooled and crumbled coarsely with your hands 
* 2 Tbs unsalted butter- melted
* 1 Tbs Kerry Gold Irish Butter Melted (just fill a pyrex measuring cup with both butters and melt them together)
* 1-1/2 Tbs brown sugar

## Ingredients Filling

* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar- packed
* 1 Tbs non fat dry milk powder or 1/4 cup cream in place of it 
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter- melted
* 6-1/2 Tbs heavy whipping cream (this is 1/4 cup plus 2 1/2 tbsp)
* 4 large egg yolks
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* powdered sugar for dusting

# Steps

This is a multi step desert as follows:

* Make crust stage 1 which is essentially a **giant** oatmeal cookie measuring roughly 1/8" think and 10 to 12" square
* Let that cookie cool 
* Make a pie crust from that cookie
* Make a filling
* Bake the filling

## Preheat

Preheat the oven to 350

## Crust Stage 1 - Prep

Start by making an oatmeal cookie for the crust. Using a stand mixer, combine 6 Tbs of room temp butter with 4 Tbs of brown sugar and 2 Tbs of white sugar. Mix until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Next, beat in one large egg.

In a separate bowl, combine the gluten free oats, 1/2 cup of gluten free flour mix, 1/8 tsp baking powder, 1/8 tsp baking soda, and a heaping 1/4 tsp of salt. Stir the dry ingredients a little at a time into the mixing bowl with the butter, sugar, and egg. Mix thoroughly.

## Crust Stage 2  - Baking

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it with non stick Pam.  Put the cookie batter on it and press it somewhat flat.  Take another sheet of parchment paper and spray it with Pam and then place it spray side down on top of the batter and flatten it further.

Pop the cookie in the preheated oven for 17-18 minutes or until golden brown. My cookie baked for about 12-13 minutes. Remove the cookie from the oven and allow it to cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack.

## Crust Stage 3 - Making A Pie Crust From It

When the cookie is completely cool, crumble it with your fingers into a medium sized bowl. Next, add 3 Tbs of melted butter and 1-1/2 Tbs of brown sugar. Mix everything together with your fingers and then press the mixture evenly into a 9inch baking pan, go up the sides as well.

## Filling

In a medium sized bowl whisk together 3/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar, 1 Tbs of nonfat dry milk powder and 1/4 tsp salt.  Add 1 stick of melted butter and whisk until blended. Finally, add 6-1/2 Tbs whipping cream, 4 egg yolks, and 1 tbsp of pure vanilla extract. Continue whisking until well blended.

## Baking

Pour the filling into the crust. Place the pie dish on a rimmed baking sheet and into a preheated 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue baking for 15-20 minutes or until the filling is brown in spots and set around the edges but the center should move slightly when shaken gently.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar. Refrigerate any left overs should they exist.
