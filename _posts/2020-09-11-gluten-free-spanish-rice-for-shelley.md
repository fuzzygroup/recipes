## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1 banana pepper
* 2 poblano pepper
* 2 c. long grain white rice
* 2 c. low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 c. tomato sauce

## Steps

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat oil. 
2. Add onion and peppers and cook until softened slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until toasted and lightly golden, 4 to 6 minutes. 
3. Stir in chicken broth, tomato puree, lemon juice, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, and cumin. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
4. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook until all liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. 
5. Remove from heat and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove lid and fluff rice with a fork. Top with cilantro and serve immediately.
