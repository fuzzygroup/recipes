Shelley and I had this one night at Origins 2019 when dining with Lisa Meece.  It was unique and delicious. 

# Ingredients

 * 1/4 pound YellowTail Tuna, sliced sashimi style (i.e. thin rectangles)
 * Ponzu sauce
 * Sriracha 
 * 1 Jalapeño, thinly sliced; seeds and ribs largely removed

# Steps

1. On a serving tray place a puddle of ponzu sauce.  This is where the sashimi will be laid.
2.  Slice the YellowTail into thin sashimi. Place each piece in the ponzu puddle.
3. Top each yellowtail with a dollop of Sriracha and then a ring of Jalapeño.

# Cocktail Accompaniment

Serve with a creamy coconut sake if at all possible.
