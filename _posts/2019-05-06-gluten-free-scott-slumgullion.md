I first learned the term [slumgullion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slumgullion) reading a Heinlein book when I was just a lad.  I’m fairly certain that it was [Starman Jones](https://www.amazon.com/Starman-Jones-Robert-Heinlein/dp/1451638442).  The term refers to a stew made from whatever is on hand.  In the book it was made by hobos who were providing shelter to the eponymous character and they all contributed a can of something to a stew pot.  I’d like to think that my version is a bit more refined but I may be kidding myself.  My wife and I needed a quick dinner the other night on the way out to a birthday party and this this slumgullion was born.  And its good enough that we’ve made it several times since.


# Ingredients

* 2 ears grilled corn or another vegetable (corn is sweet though so it works well)
* Parmesan cheese
* 1 can Bush’s beans; I particularly like the [Southern Style White Beans](https://www.amazon.com/Bushs-Best-Southern-Style-Savory/dp/B078WRR25T/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bushs+southern+white+beans&qid=1557148766&s=gateway&sr=8-2)
* Salt / red pepper flakes / pepper / hot sauce (whatever your palate calls for)
* Cooked, diced chicken breast (or steak or pork chops or shrimp) (adding this at the end takes this from a side dish to a full meal); amount depends on preference
* Good olive oil, flavored if you have it, Tuscan Herb flavor is great, maybe half a tablespoon, tops

# Steps

1.  Remove the kernels of corn from the cob.
2.  Add everything to a glass bowl save the olive oil.
3.  Stir the ingredients together.
4.  Heat for 2 minutes to 2 1/2 minutes depending on quantity of protein.
5.  Top with the olive oil.  Season to your liking.
