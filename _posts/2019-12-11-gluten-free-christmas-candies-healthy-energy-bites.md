These are delightfully simple and couldn't be easier to make.  And they have the advantage that they are actually pretty healthy (at least by candy standards).

## Ingredients

* 1 cup dry oatmeal
* 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes or sweetened angel flake coconut; either works
* 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, chopped
* 1/2 cup peanut butter or almond butter; peanut butter works just fine and tastes great
* 1/3 cup honey or brown rice syrup; honey works just fine and you are more likely to have honey on hand
* 1 tbsp vanilla

## Steps

1. Add ingredients to standing mixer and mix well.
2. Let chill in fridge for 1/2 hour.
3. Once chilled, roll into balls.
4. Store in airtight container and keep refrigerated. That’s it!
