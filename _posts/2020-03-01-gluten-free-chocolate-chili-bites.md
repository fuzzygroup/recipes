No one ever talks about it but I find that picking the right recipe to cook is as much an art as cooking itself.  My friend Lisa did just that the other day for a dinner party.  She paired this recipe with a taco bar composed of [Dundon's Pork al Pastor](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/mexican/2020/02/25/dundon-s-pork-al-pastor.html) and it was spectacular with the chili in them nicely providing the right accompaniment to the pork itself.

## Ingredients

* 200 grams (7 ounces, 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons) butter
* 200 grams (7 ounces) good-quality dark chocolate, chopped
* 160 grams (3/4 cup) sugar
* 4 eggs
* 1 rounded tablespoon gluten-free flour; you can omit the flour also but I didn't try that
* 1 1/2 teaspoon ground chili pepper
* a good pinch of fine sea salt

## Steps

1. Pre-heat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Melt the butter with the chocolate in a small saucepan or in a bowl in the microwave. If melting in the microwave, be sure to do it slowly, blending with a spoon between each pass.
3. Transfer into a mixing bowl, add in the sugar, mix with a wooden spoon and let cool a little. Add the eggs one by one, mixing well with the spoon after each addition. Add a rounded tablespoon of flour, the ground chili and salt, and mix well.
4. Pour the dough in the mini muffin tins, and put into the oven to bake for ten to twelve minutes. The top should look set, but the inside should still be on the soft side.  Use a toothpick to make sure that they are cooked fully.
5. Let the the mini bites cool down enough to unmold them, then transfer to a rack to cool completely while you cook the other batches. Store in a plastic container, refrigerate, and take out about an hour prior to serving the next day.
