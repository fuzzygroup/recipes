This is so simple that it is less a recipe than a technique but who ever looks for techniques?

## Ingredients

* Spaghetti Squash
* 1/2 Cup Water

You'll also need:

* Saran Wrap
* Glass Baking Dish
* Microwave

## Steps

1.  Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.
2.  Place it cut side down in a glass baking dish and add the water.
3. Cover it with saran wrap or plastic wrap.
4. Microwave it for 20 minutes.
5. Scoop the strands out with a fork.  Season with olive oil and garlic salt or a pan sauce or anything at all.
