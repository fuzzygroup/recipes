This is the same juice mixture served at DisneyWorld in Animal Kingdom and the Grand Floridian:

# Ingredients

* orange juice
* guava juice
* passion fruit juice

# Steps

Combine in equal proportions and drink!

# The Cocktail Version

Make the juice and then combine with champagne to make what I call a "Tropical Shelley" cocktail.
