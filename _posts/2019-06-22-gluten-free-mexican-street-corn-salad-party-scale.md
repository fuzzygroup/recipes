I make this recipe a lot for parties.  The key ingredient is corn on the cob and my local Kroger sells husked corn on the cob in packs of 7.  This recipe is thus scaled for 3 packs of corn or 21 ears.  Here is the the [original, also gluten free, scaled down version](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/mexican/2016/07/11/mexican-street-corn-salad.html).
# Ingredients

* 21 ears fresh corn, shucked

* tinfoil to wrap corn in

* 1 1/4 cup mayo

* 1 1/4 cup greek yogurt

* 3 cups parmesan

* 3 tbsp chili powder (more if you like it spicy)

* 5 cloves garlic diced

* 1 1/4 cups diced cilantro

* Juice of 3 limes

# Steps

1.  Wrap corn in tinfoil.  The most efficient way to do this is to cut 21 pieces of foil at once and then wrap them in batch. Trust me -- I've made a lot of this.

2.  Preheat grill at high for 5 to 10 minutes.  Place corn on grill and grill for 28 minutes in four 7 minute intervals turning it 90 degrees at a time.  Remove from grill.  Cool on cutting board and then remove kernels.  The best way to remove kernels of corn is to use a bundt cake pan and set the ear of corn upright on the tube portion.  Then you take a sharp chef's knife and cut down the cob.  Bonus points to you if you made a Corn Spikey device per my directions to ease the cob removal process.

3.  In a standing mixer combine all the ingredients except for the corn.  This is the "dressing" for the salat

3.  In large mixing bowl combine corn and remaining ingredients.  Taste.  If too little dressing make a second batch and add it in until you are pleased.

# Notes

Original recipe called for sour cream; greek yogurt is better
