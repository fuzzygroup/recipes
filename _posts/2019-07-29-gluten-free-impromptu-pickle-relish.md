So I was hosting a barbecue recently and one of the guests said "Do you have any pickle relish"?  While I grew up with relish and I really like pickles, I have normally found it a confusing condiment to say the least.  Never the less, "Challenge Accepted" I muttered while channeling the spirit of Barney Stinson.  This was the result of a quick google and then an "Oh Shite" moment where I realized I had damn few appropriate ingredients.  And it as completely an off the cuff recipe so is it actually "Pickle Relish"?  I don't know but the requester seemed to like it.

# Ingredients

* Diced Claussen Kosher Dill Sandwich Slice Pickles (that's what I used but any dill pickle could be used)
* Diced onion in proportion to the amount of diced pickle; you want about 1/3 onion to pickle
* Apple Cider Vinegar also in proportion to the pickle and onion totality

# Steps
1.  Dice the pickle and onion.
2.  In a small frying pan bring the cider vinegar to a boil and reduce it slightly to make it syrupy.
3.  Add the pickle and onion and stir it around letting the heat of the boiling vinegar cook it slightly.
4.  Take it off the heat and leave it in the hot pan for a minute or two.
