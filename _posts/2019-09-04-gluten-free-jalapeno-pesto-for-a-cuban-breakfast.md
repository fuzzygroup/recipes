tags: ["sauce", "cuban"]
---
# Ingredients

* 2 Cups Baby Spinach
* 2 Jalapeños, stemmed and roughly chopped (remove the seeds and ribs for less heat, leave it as is for more)
* 1/4 C Cilantro
* 2 Cloves Garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1/4 C Walnuts, toasted
* 1/2 C Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 1/2 C grated Cotija cheese; substitute feta or parmesan

# Steps

1.  In food processor, combine spinach, jalapeños, cilantro, garlic, and walnuts and process until finely chopped. 
2. With processor running, add Extra Virgin Olive oil until mixture is cohesive, about 10 seconds. 
3. Transfer mixture to medium bowl and stir in cheese. 
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste (Pesto can be divided and frozen in 1/4 C increments for future breakfasts!).
