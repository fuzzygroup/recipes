This is a double batch and it makes approximately 20 biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 5 cups blanched almond flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 7 tbsp butter, melted (or ghee, or melted coconut oil)
* 2 tbsp pure honey (I prefer sage honey due to its mild flavor)
* 4 tbsp pure coconut milk (room temperature is best), milk or buttermilk
* 4 large eggs (room temperature is best)
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
2. In a large bowl, combine almond flour, baking soda and salt and whisk.
3. In a stand mixer, whisk together melted butter (or coconut oil) and honey, until smooth. 
4. Add the milk, eggs and vinegar, whisking together until well combined.
5. Using a spoon, stir the wet mixture into the dry mixture until thoroughly combined.
6. For quick and easy drop biscuits: Drop biscuit dough by large spoonfuls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, placing the biscuits approximately two-inches apart.
7. For classic-style rolled-looking biscuits: Scoop a large spoonful of batter into your hands and roll into a ball about the size of an apricot. Then place the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet and gently flatten using the palm of your hand.
8. Bake about 15 minutes, until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean. Serve warm with butter, raw honey or homemade jam.
