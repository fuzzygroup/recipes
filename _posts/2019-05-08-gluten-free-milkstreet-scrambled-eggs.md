Scrambled eggs are one of those foods that can be both prosaic as well as high art.  When I take the time to make scrambled eggs and want to elevate them, this is one of my two approaches (the other takes a crap ton longer; alas; wistful sigh).  This one is fast enough that once you internalize it, you can make it most mornings.  The best description I can give of these eggs is that they are both fluffy and eggy.  I know eggy as a description is, well, self referential, but I always feel like I'm really tasting the egg in this recipe.

I found this recipe originally from [Milk Street Magazine](https://www.177milkstreet.com/recipes/fluffy-olive-oil-scrambled-eggs) and I have adapted down from 8 eggs to four accordingly since that's the sizing I generally need.

# Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 1 tbsp olive oil (this seems like a lot; it isn't; trust me)
* salt

# Steps

1.  Get a plate out and put it to the side of the stove where you cook your eggs.  Bonus points if you warm the plate but we both know you aren't going to do that.
2.  Take a small six inch frying pan out and put it on medium heat.  
3.  Add 1 tbsp olive oil to the pan.
4.  Let the olive oil heat for 3 minutes.  Yes that's a lot and that's why you are on medium not high (says the recipe writer to every male cook out there who only cooks on HIGH; yes that's usually me).
5.  Beat the eggs with the desired amount of salt until mixed and frothy.
6.  When the oil is hot, add the eggs to the center of the pan and with a rubber spatula continuously stir the eggs.  Push them towards the middle as they begin to set around the edges and fold the cooked eggs over on themselves.
7.  Cook until the eggs are just set, 60 to 90 seconds.  They should appear shiny, wet and soft but not running.
