# Ingredients

* 3	cups (15 oz) unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for the work surface
* ¼	t rapid-rise or instant yeast
* 1	t salt
* ¾	cup water, room temperature
* ½	cup mild-flavored beer, room temperature
* 1	T white vinegar
* vegetable oil spray

# Steps

1. Whisk the flour, yeast and salt together in a large bowl.  Fold in the water, beer, and vinegar with a rubber spatula until the dough comes together and looks shaggy.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours, or up to 18 hours.

2. Lay an 18x12" sheet of parchment paper inside a 10" skillet and spray with vegetable oil spray.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand to form a smooth dough, round ball, 10-15 times.  Shape the doug into a ball by pulling the edges into the middle with floured hands. Transfer the dough, seamside down, to the prepare skillet.  

3. Mist the dough with vegetable oil spray and cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size and the dough barely springs back when poked with a knuckle, about 2 hours.

4. About 30 mins before baking, adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a large, covered Dutch oven on the rack and heat the oven to 500.

5. Lightly flour the top of the dough and score the top of the loaf with a razor blade or sharp knife.  Carefully remove the pot from the oven and remove the lid.  Pick up the parchment and dough and carefully lower them into the hot pot, letting any excess parchment hang over the edge.  Cover the pot.

6. Place the pot in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 425, and bake covered for 30 mins. Remove the lid and continue to bake until the center of the loaf registers 210 degrees on an instant-read thermometer and the crust is deep golden brown, 20-30 mins.  Carefully remove the bread from the pot, transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before serving.
