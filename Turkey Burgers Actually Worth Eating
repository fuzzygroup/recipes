# Ingredients

* Ground Turkey (6 oz patties * number of people; this recipe is for 4 so 24 ounces turkey)

* 2 tbsp bacon grease

* 1 tsp salt

# Steps

1.  In kitchen aid using the paddle mix turkey, bacon grease and salt until bacon grease is well incorporated.

2.  Form into 4 equal patties (I use a scale; OCD?  Nope.  It is CDO -- that's alphabetized).

3.  Par freeze for 20 minutes before grilling.  This helps them keep their shape as turkey doesn't have that much internal structure particularly after vigorous mixing.

4.  Grill for 4 minutes per side on high.  A nice char on the outside is really essential for flavor.
